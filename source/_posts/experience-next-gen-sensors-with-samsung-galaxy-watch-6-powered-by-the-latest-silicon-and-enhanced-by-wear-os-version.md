## Experience Next-Gen Sensors with Samsung Galaxy Watch 6: Powered by the Latest Silicon and Enhanced by Wear OS Version

As far as [smartwatches](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/can-i-use-itools-gpx-file-to-catch-the-rare-pokemon-on-poco-f5-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) go, Samsung is one step ahead of most Wear OS watchmakers. Back in 2021, Samsung brought to the market the very first smartwatch running Wear OS 3, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 series. Now, the company is doing it again with the first Wear OS 4 watches, the Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic.

 Samsung's Unpacked event has just taken place, and the company announced a lot of new, exciting tech, including two new foldable phones — the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the Galaxy Z Flip 5\. And like clockwork (no pun intended), we're also getting new watches. The Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic are the successors to the Galaxy Watch 5 and Watch 5 Pro, and they come with a wide range of improvements over Samsung's older smartwatches.

 Perhaps the one you'll notice straight out is a revival of an older feature. Samsung attempted to kill off the physical rotating bezel with the release of the Watch 5 Pro last year, but not everyone loved that move. So with the Watch 6 series, Samsung is back to the rotating bezel. The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is reviving the fan-favorite rotating bezel, with a stainless steel case and an "eco-leather" band helping it feel as premium as possible. The standard Galaxy Watch 6 is just how you've come to expect over the last couple of generations — a touch bezel with an aluminum body and a sport band. The bezel in the Galaxy Watch 6 is 30% thinner, while the rotating one in the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is 15% thinner than the one in the Watch 4 Classic.

Justin Duino / How-To Geek

 Both the Galaxy Watch 6 and the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic are powered by the new Exynos W930, meaning this is the first time Samsung is putting new silicon on its watches in two years — the Galaxy Watch 4 used the Exynos W920, and the Watch 5 re-used it. We're also getting two sizes for each — the Watch 6 comes in 40mm and 44mm sizes, and the Watch 6 Classic comes in 43mm and a new, ultra-big 47mm size.

 Other than this, both watches come with roughly the same features. The 40mm Watch 6 has the same 1.3-inch display and 300mAh battery as the 43mm Classic, while the 44mm Watch 6 has the same 1.5-inch display and 425mAh battery as the 47mm Classic. Both have 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, and both have the same 5ATM + IP68 ratings and MIL-STD-810H certification. Finally, both are running Wear OS 4, Google's latest and greatest smartwatch operating system.

 The Galaxy Watch 6 and the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic will be available priced at $299.99/$329.99 (40mm/44mm) and $399.99/$429.99 (43mm/47mm), respectively.
