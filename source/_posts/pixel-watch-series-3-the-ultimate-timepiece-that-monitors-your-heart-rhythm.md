## Pixel Watch Series 3: The Ultimate Timepiece That Monitors Your Heart Rhythm

We've seen a push from companies over the past few years for new, life-saving health features. Satellite communications can allow you to get help in those specific cases where you're stranded without a cell signal. Now, the new Pixel Watch 3 might actually literally save your life with one of its new features.

 Google's latest smartwatch, the [Pixel Watch 3](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-6-effortless-steps-to-add-social-media-live-content-online/), includes a feature called Loss of Pulse Detection. This feature, which Google says is the first of its kind, aims to save lives by automatically calling emergency services if it detects that the wearer has lost their heart pulse and is unresponsive. Many cardiac arrests (heart attacks) occur when people are alone, and victims are often unable to call for help themselves, sometimes leading to death. The Pixel Watch 3's new feature addresses this by utilizing a combination of sensors, AI, and signal-processing algorithms to detect such events.

 The watch's Heart Rate sensor constantly monitors the user's pulse using green light. If signs of pulselessness are detected, infrared and red lights are also activated for additional confirmation, while the motion sensor looks for movement. An AI algorithm analyzes this data to confirm a loss of pulse. If a loss of pulse event is confirmed, the watch initiates a check-in, asking the user if they are okay and looking for motion. If there's no response, an audio alarm and countdown are triggered. Finally, if the user remains unresponsive, the watch automatically calls emergency services and provides them with the user's location and the nature of the emergency.

 Loss of Pulse Detection will be available on Pixel Watch 3 in September in several European countries, with plans to expand to more countries in the future. Google is presumably waiting on FDA approval to use the feature in the United States.
