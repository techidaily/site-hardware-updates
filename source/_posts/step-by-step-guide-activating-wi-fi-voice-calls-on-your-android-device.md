##  How to Turn On Wi-Fi Calling on Android

 Wi-Fi calling can usually be enabled by going into the Settings of the "Phone" app and toggling it on. However, with some carriers, you have to turn on Wi-Fi calling with their app. We'll share a few examples below.

 On Samsung Galaxy devices, go to the default "Phone" app and tap the three-dot icon in the middle right. Select "Settings" and toggle on "Wi-Fi Calling" if it's not already.

 With the "[Phone by Google](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU219256/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.dialer&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)" app—[which can be made the default dialer](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-screen-mirroring-nokia-g42-5g-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/)—tap the three-dot menu icon in the top right and select "Settings." Then go to Calls/Calling Accounts > Wi-Fi Calling > toggle it on. You may need to select your SIM card first.

 Google Fi is one carrier that makes you enable Wi-Fi calling through its app (on non-Pixel devices). To do this, open the [Google Fi app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU219256/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tycho&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) and select "Wi-Fi Calling" on the "Account" tab. That will take you to the screen to toggle it on.

 Depending on your Android phone and carrier, this process may look different. You can also [search for "Wi-Fi Calling" in the Settings app](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-simplify-virtual-collaboration-a-zoom-setup-overview/) to see if the option is available there.

##  How to Use Wi-Fi Calling

 Good news—using Wi-Fi calling is exactly the same as making and [receiving regular phone calls](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-top-5-methods-to-record-high-quality-audio-on-windows/). Once enabled, you don't have to do anything else. If you're connected to a solid Wi-Fi network, your phone will automatically use Wi-Fi calling as the preferred method.

 Typically, you can look for a Wi-Fi icon to see if Wi-Fi calling is being used. The icon may appear on the calling screen and on the recent calls list, as shown below in the "Phone by Google" app.

 If you leave the Wi-Fi network, the call will automatically switch over to 5G, LTE, or the next best connection. You may notice a slight hiccup in the call, but it's usually pretty seamless.

##  What is Wi-Fi Calling on Android?

[Wi-Fi calling](https://solve-hot.techidaily.com/boost-analytics-with-our-cookiebot-integration-solutions/) is exactly what it sounds like—phone calls are made over Wi-Fi instead of your phone's cellular connection. While this has been a feature found on Android for many years, it's still something many people don't know exists.

 The beauty of Wi-Fi calling is it essentially just works without you needing to think about anything. Once enabled, your Android phone will automatically use Wi-Fi calling if you're [connected to a solid Wi-Fi network](https://win11.techidaily.com/addressing-ntoskrnlexe-overload-issue/), and switch to cellular when needed without dropping the call.

 There was a time when not all [cellular carriers](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/virtually-profitable-gaming-channels-for-2024/) and [Android phones](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/hot-takes-highlight-twitters-trending-topics-for-2024/) supported Wi-Fi calling, but that's not the case anymore. AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and most other carriers—including [MVNOs](https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-audio-clarity-the-most-effective-noise-reduction-tools-revealed/) such as [Mint Mobile](https://fox-info.techidaily.com/mastering-zoom-for-enhanced-tiktok-streams/) and [Google Fi](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-screencast-technology-with-itop-review/)—now support the feature.

##  Is Wi-Fi Calling Free?

 Wi-Fi calling may count toward your plan's talk and text allotment, but it does not use mobile data.

 Some carriers, unfortunately, treat Wi-Fi calls the same as standard calls. It's not the same as using third-party calling apps such as [Google Meet](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/expert-tips-on-maintaining-a-crystal-clear-hdtv-view/) or [Skype](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/1722960782294-free-download-official-windows-compatible-msi-gs65-drivers-get-them-now/). Check with your carrier to see if Wi-Fi calling is counted toward your minutes.

 Wi-Fi calling does not use the data allotted to your plan. In this way, Wi-Fi calling is treated the same as third-party apps. Anything you do on your smartphone that uses Wi-Fi doesn't use mobile data, and that includes Wi-Fi calling.
