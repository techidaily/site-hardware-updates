 Turning Wi-Fi off when you're away from frequently-used networks can [save some battery life on your Android phone](https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-add-green-screen-effects-in-phhotoshop/). The annoying thing is you have to remember to turn it back on---or do you?

 Depending on where you are, your phone's constant scanning for a Wi-Fi network can eat up battery, which is why some people turn it off away from home. We'll show you a simple setting that can automatically turn Wi-Fi back on when you're near your common networks.
