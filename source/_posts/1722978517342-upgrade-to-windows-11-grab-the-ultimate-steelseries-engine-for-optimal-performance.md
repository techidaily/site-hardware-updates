 The SteelSeries Engine is an app that provides a unified platform to support all SteelSeries products. This app not only can manage all your SteelSeries devices but also combines all the common features for gamers, making you easy to customize each key and functions to suit your habit when playing games.

This feature can also be used for your other applications, the Steelseries engine can open the corresponding profile when you start up this application.
