##  What to Look For in a Boombox in 2024

 We live in a different world than the one that produced the boomboxes of old. As much as we might feel nostalgic for the style and utility of older boomboxes, that doesn't mean we're not looking for modern features.

[Bluetooth](https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-insta-to-tik-integration-masterclass/), or wireless communication in general, is the cornerstone of those modern features we're talking about. For most of us, our phone, tablet, or computer is the main source of our music. Every model we're looking at in this article features Bluetooth, so the boomboxes can link to these devices and play the sounds you want.

 Of course, if you're looking for improved audio fidelity, you might prefer another option on your boombox, like an auxiliary input jack. Not every boombox we're looking at here has an aux jack, but we'll mention when they do.

 If you're looking to buy a boombox, chances are good that you're also looking for one with a built-in radio. Most of the boomboxes we're focusing on in this article feature a built-in radio, but not all do, and some are limited to FM radio only.

 The original boomboxes relied on physical media in addition to their built-in radios. More and more people are going digital-only with their music, so this may not apply to you. But if you have physical media, you're likely looking for a CD player. Some of the boomboxes we're highlighting here also feature cassette playback if you're feeling truly old-school.

 Finally, size is a major consideration. Some people want something small and portable, while others seek something huge that pumps out the sound. Before you decide on a boombox, it's important to consider just when and how you'll be using it to make sure you're buying the proper size.

 If you're ready to pick up a modern boombox, check out one of our recommendations below!

##  Best Boombox Overall: [JBL Boombox 2](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Boombox-Waterproof-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B086C14ZPY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206669&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789900%2Fthe-best-boomboxes%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) 

![People on rooftop with JBL boombox](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/jbl-boombox-2.jpg) 

JBL

| Pros                     | Cons                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Can get very loud        | No CD player or radio |
| Massive bass response    |                       |
| Waterproof               |                       |
| Can charge other devices |                       |

 To some people, the very idea of a boombox is defined by the image of a giant rectangular contraption with a cassette deck and a radio. For others, it's all about the volume. The [JBL Boombox 2](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Boombox-Waterproof-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B086C14ZPY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206669&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789900%2Fthe-best-boomboxes%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is meant for the latter camp, and the ultra-modern boombox design brings the party wherever you go.

 If there's one thing JBL wants you to know about its Boombox 2, it's that it's loud. If there's another thing the company wants you to know, it's that it can pump out some serious bass. And that's not enough, you can link it up with other JBL PartyBoost-compatible speakers to play music over multiple speakers at once.

 Compared to some of the other boomboxes we're looking at, the JBL Boombox 2 is essentialy a large [Bluetooth speaker](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-photo-perfection-highest-rated-phone-tripods/) with a handle. It doesn't have a built-in CD player or radio, though there is an auxiliary input jack. Similarly, the extras are more in line with what you'd expect from a Bluetooth speaker.

 For example, the speaker can double as a power bank thanks to its massive battery, which can provide up to 24 hours of playback time, depending on volume. This speaker is also [IPX7-rated waterproof](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), meaning you don't have to worry about bringing it to a picnic or outdoor party.

 The built-in handle makes carrying the Boombox 2 easy, but at around 13 pounds, it isn't exactly light. That said, if you don't care about CDs or the radio but do care about powerful sound, JBL's offering is tough to beat.

| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Packed with features for the price | Radio limited to FM only |
| Features five onboard EQ options   |                          |
| Comes in three color varieties     |                          |

 While parts have generally come down in price over the years, the sheer feature sets packed into budget boomboxes have grown in the past few years. For example, the [MEGATEK Portable CD Player Boombox](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087F3GHSW/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206669&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789900%2Fthe-best-boomboxes%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) features typical boombox mainstays, but also several other useful ways to connect and listen.

 To start, you get a CD player and FM radio, both key features of a more traditional boombox. While the radio's FM limitation is somewhat disappointing, the CD player makes up for it. This model can also play MP3 CDs, which lets you pack much more music onto a single disc, perfect for playlists or even audiobooks.

 That said, if you prefer more modern forms of connectivity, you’ll find them here as well. The boombox features Bluetooth input, letting you pair your phone or another device. It also features USB playback, letting you easily play media from a flash drive. The boombox also features an aux-in for wired connectivity.

 This is a smaller, more portable boombox, meaning the speakers are three inches in diameter. Still, they’re stereo, and you get a built-in EQ with five presets to tune the music to your liking. The MEGATEK also features a headphone out port.

 For power, you’ll need three [C batteries](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Rechargeable-Batteries-5000mAh-4-Pack/dp/B07PHCVSSS?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206669&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789900%2Fthe-best-boomboxes%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), or you can plug in the included AC cable.

The MEGATEK Portable CD Player Boombox is packed with features considering the bargain price, complete with a CD player, FM radio, Bluetooth, and USB playback. Plus, it features five onboard EQ presets and comes in three different colors.

[$50 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087F3GHSW/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206669&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789900%2Fthe-best-boomboxes%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) 

##  Best Bluetooth Boombox: [Anker Soundcore Motion Boom](https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Titanium-Technology-Waterproof-Bluetooth/dp/B08LQNL42Z?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206669&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789900%2Fthe-best-boomboxes%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term)

| Pros                          | Cons                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Spacious stereo sound         | Smaller size means a somewhat lower volume |
| Excellent bass response       |                                            |
| Waterproof and floats         |                                            |
| Lightweight and easy to carry |                                            |

 If you like the idea of a modern-style boombox, like our best overall pick, but don't want to pay the premium price, the [Anker Soundcore Motion Boom](https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Titanium-Technology-Waterproof-Bluetooth/dp/B08LQNL42Z?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206669&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789900%2Fthe-best-boomboxes%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a fantastic alternative. It offers much of the same potential for volume and room-shaking bass but at a price that's much easier to swallow.

 Like the [JBL Boombox 2](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Boombox-Waterproof-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B086C14ZPY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206669&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789900%2Fthe-best-boomboxes%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), the Anker Soundcore Motion Boom is a boombox evolved from a Bluetooth speaker. In addition to stereo sound, Anker boasts that this speaker's titanium driver diaphragm provides bass you can feel and clarity up to frequencies that you can't even hear.

 The Anker Soundcore Motion Boom is meant to go anywhere with you, thanks to its IPX7-rated waterproof design. This speaker will also float, meaning you can feel safe when you bring it to a pool party, even if the boombox happens to take a dive.

 You can make sure that the party keeps going, too. Anker claims that the 10,000 mAh battery in the Soundcore Motion Boom can keep the music playing for up to 24 hours. This will vary with volume, but it's still impressive.

 While this is a smaller speaker than JBL's similar boombox, that also means it's significantly lighter. At a little over four pounds, it's easy to carry wherever you may be headed. If you're looking for a quality boombox that doesn't have a CD player, Anker's option is one of your best bets that won't break the bank.

 Philips may not be the first name that comes to mind when you imagine a boombox, but the company has been making them since the 1970s. While the form factor hasn't changed much, the style and features of the [Philips Portable CD Player](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Bluetooth-Cassette-Powerful-Backlight/dp/B0BXBJ3P42/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206669&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789900%2Fthe-best-boomboxes%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) show how far the humble boombox has come over the years.

 As a glance at the front reveals, the Philips offers nearly anything you'll likely look for in a modern boombox. You have the advertised CD player, but also a built-in cassette deck and FM radio, complete with 30 memory presets. Beyond these traditional features, you'll find some more modern touches as well.

 Like many boomboxes available these days, the Philips features a USB port for playing back files from portable storage, with a maximum supported capacity of 128GB. You also get Bluetooth connectivity for playing music from your phone, tablet, or computer. In a feature you won't find in every boombox, this model has a remote to let you skip songs and adjust volume without standing next to the controls.

 For connecting players that don't have Bluetooth, you get a 3.5mm auxiliary input jack, and Philips even included a cable. You also get another 3.5mm jack for the headphone output. That said, don't forget about the speakers built into the boombox when you want to crank the volume, complete with a bass boost to enhance the low end.

 If you want to keep the Philips Portable CD Player portable, you'll need six [D batteries](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-All-Purpose-Alkaline-Batteries/dp/B00MH4QKP6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206669&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789900%2Fthe-best-boomboxes%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). That said, for home listening, you can plug into AC power, but you'll still need a single AAA battery for the remote. The boombox is available in black/blue or black/red color options.

| Comes with a rechargeable battery             |              |

 If you don't think the other boomboxes on this list look _quite_ right, you may have a specific aesthetic in mind. In that case, you might like the [Audiocrazy Retro Boombox](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09P83CW7B/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206669&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F789900%2Fthe-best-boomboxes%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), which is inspired by boomboxes of yesteryear but also comes with smart modern connectivity.

 From the slide-style radio dial to the big, plastic, chunky buttons on top, this boombox is dripping with vintage style. Audiocrazy has even added features you’d typically never expect to see on a boombox, like old-school VU meters instead of LED lights showing the playback volume.

 The radio we’ve already mentioned, but what would a retro boombox be without a cassette deck? Don’t worry, you get one here, as well as a 3.5mm auxiliary input. If you’ve got a bunch of music files to play, the boombox supports playback from USB drives, or you can pair your phone via Bluetooth and listen that way.

 Interestingly enough, the Audiocrazy has rather flexible routing when it comes to recording. You can record from the onboard tape deck or radio to USB for ease of digital capture. On the other hand, if you’d rather travel a bit back in time, you can record from USB or Bluetooth directly onto the cassette deck to make your own mixtapes.

 When it comes to power, Audiocrazy’s Retro Boombox offers plenty of options. It comes with a 2,500mAh rechargeable battery, but you can also supply your own batteries as backups. If you’re using the boombox at home or anywhere else near a handy outlet, you can also plug it in with the included AC power plug.
