 Did you know you could make your Samsung Galaxy Phone experience much smoother just by using hand movements? The Motion and Gestures features let you carry out actions like muting alerts, taking screenshots, and turning the screen on and off more easily.

##  How To Turn On Motion And Gestures

 Samsung Galaxy Phones are [packed with often overlooked features](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-trendsetting-techniques-going-viral-in-the-digital-world/) that make it much easier to navigate your device. The Motion and Gestures section of the Settings is a great example of that.

 We'll explain what they do and how they work! Note that the features available and shown below may differ based on your specific Samsung device and its software version.

##  1\. Lift To Wake

 With Lift To Wake, when you pick up your phone, your screen wakes up and comes on. This feature is great for quickly checking the time or notifications without having to press the power button or double-tap the screen.

##  2\. Double Tap To Turn On and Off Screen

 You can double-tap the screen to wake it up, making it easy to check for notifications or quickly access your phone's features without having to reach for the power button.

 This also works to turn the screen off as long as you use Samsung's default home screen launcher. Just tap twice on any empty space on your Home or Lock Screen.

##  3\. Keep Screen On While Viewing

 This feature keeps the screen on while you're looking at it. The front-facing sensors detect when your eyes are looking at the screen. This is especially useful when reading long articles or recipes without having to constantly touch the screen to prevent it from timing out.

##  4\. Alert When Phone Picked Up

 With this, you get alerted with a vibration when you pick up your phone if you have missed notifications. This feature makes sure you never miss an important message or call. You don't even need to turn on the screen to know something is awaiting your attention.

##  5\. Mute With Gestures

 Mute incoming calls or alarms by placing your hand over the screen [or turning the device over](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-leading-selection-top-6-fb-lite-vids/). This is handy when you need to quickly silence your phone without fumbling for buttons or the annoying dismiss call gesture.

##  6\. Palm Swipe To Capture

 There are a surprising number of methods to [take a screenshot on a Samsung phone](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/gamers-guides-essential-tips-for-recording-riveting-races/). One such method is swiping the edge of your hand across the screen. This gesture is a quick and easy way to capture what's on your screen without having to remember a button combo.
