## Experience the Game Like Never Before with the Discounted Acer Nitro Monitor - Now $81

Today at Walmart, you can find the[Acer Nitro ED240Q Sbiip](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?subId1=techidaily-us-9012241473682263508&sharedId=techidaily-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F863681547) 24-inch curved FHD gaming monitor for one of its lowest prices. It usually goes for around $199, which is already a reasonable price for a curved gaming display with an AMD FreeSync Premium certification. However, today's discount takes the price down to just $81.

 This price is even cheaper than the going rate on the official Acer website. As of this writing, Walmart has not specified an expiration date for the offer, so we're unsure how long it will be available at a discount.
