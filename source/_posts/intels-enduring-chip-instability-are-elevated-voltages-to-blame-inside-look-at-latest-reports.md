## AMD Takes the Lead with Fastest New Mobile Chip Against Apple's M3 Max - Multi-Core War Commences

AMD’s next-generation mobile and desktop chips are expected to launch in July, and we’ve seen some benchmark results for the top-end [Ryzen AI 9 HX 370](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/ryzen-ai-9-hx-370-delivers-intel-beating-single-core-performance) gradually appearing online. Hardware detective [HXL](https://twitter.com/9550pro/status/1813896531352953040) shared a photograph of a Cinebench R23 test showing AMD’s latest processor running Windows 10\. As with all leaks, treat the results with a pinch of salt. The Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 reportedly achieved a single-core score of 2,010 points, while its multi-core performance hit 23,302.

 The HX 370 seemingly beats both the AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX3D and the Intel Core Ultra 9 185H in single-core performance, but it’s still outclassed by the former in terms of multi-core score owing to the Ryzen 9 7945HX3D’s eight extra threads. It’s also interesting to see the new AMD chip getting a higher single-core score than the Apple M3 Max and a multi-score performance within a stone’s throw of Apple’s top laptop chip.

| Processor               | Single-Core Score | Multi-Core Score | \# of Cores (threads)  | Base Clock (GHz) | Boost Clock (GHz) |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370   | 2,010             | 23,302           | 12 (24)                | 2                | 5.1               |
| AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX3D    | 1,931             | 33,450           | 16 (32)                | 2.3              | 5.4               |
| Intel Core Ultra 9 185H | 1,849             | 16,750           | 6 (12) + 8 (8) + 2 (2) | 2.3 + 1.8 + 1    | 5.1 + 3.8 + 2.5   |
| Apple M3 Max            | 1,968             | 24,028           | 16 (16)                | 4.05             | 4.05              |

 We do have an issue with the conducted test, though, as AMD has dropped support for Windows 10 on its[Ryzen AI 300](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-unwraps-ryzen-ai-300-series-strix-point-processors-50-tops-of-ai-performance-zen-5c-density-cores-come-to-ryzen-9-for-the-first-time) series processors. Nevertheless, resourceful PC enthusiasts could find a way to make it work, or maybe AMD did not include Windows 10 in its documentation, but the hardware could still run it.

 Cinebench R23 focuses more on productivity; thus, these results show that the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 packs some muscle. However, the leaker didn’t indicate what other parts this system has, so we don’t have the complete picture of how it would perform in the real world.

 With the launch just a few weeks away, many AMD fans would be excited to get their hands on its latest processors. But we recommend holding off on your purchases until tech reviewers get their hands on these laptops and run them through their paces. That way, you know which options to look at and can get your money’s worth on the new computer you’ll buy.
