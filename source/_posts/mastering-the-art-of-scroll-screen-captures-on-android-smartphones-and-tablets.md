## Mastering the Art of Scroll Screen Captures on Android Smartphones and Tablets

### Key Takeaways

* To take a scrolling screenshot on most Android devices, open an app with vertical scrolling and take a screenshot as usual. Then, tap "Capture More" from the screenshot preview menu to automatically capture more of the screen vertically.

 Taking a screenshot is a core Android feature, but it has changed a bit over the years. Android 11 introduced a new screenshot UI, and subsequent versions have built upon that. We'll show you how to capture long page screenshots.

 What is a "scrolling screenshot?" A normal screenshot will capture only what you can see on the screen at that moment. A scrolling screenshot allows you to take a longer screenshot that includes everything that you'd see by scrolling up or down the screen.

 Scrolling screenshots work in most apps, and the process is essentially the same on most Android devices. If you have a Samsung device, check out our full guide on screenshots, specifically the [scrolling screenshots section.](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/sound-seekers-free-beats-detection-tools-for-2024/) 

##  How to Take Long Screenshots on Android

 First, open an app with vertical scrolling and [take a screenshot like you normally would](https://location-social.techidaily.com/3-things-you-must-know-about-fake-snapchat-location-on-samsung-galaxy-f15-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). That's typically done by pressing the physical Power + Volume Down buttons until the screen flashes.

 Next, tap "Capture More" from the screenshot preview menu. If an app doesn't allow the scrolling screenshot feature, the "Capture More" button won't be present.

 Android will automatically capture more of the screen vertically. You'll be brought to a screen where you can crop the screenshot. Use the handles to select the area of the screenshot that you want to use.

 Once you're done with that, you can either tap "Save" to finish or the pencil icon to make more edits, such as drawing or annotating the screenshot and adding text.

 That's it! This is a nice way to take screenshots of more than what you can see on the screen. It would be a lot more time-consuming to stitch screenshots together manually. Keep in mind that the results aren't always flawlessâ€”it depends on which app you're in.
