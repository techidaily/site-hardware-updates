 The home screen is most likely the screen that you see most often on your phone. There are a number of things we can do to freshen it up, starting with installing a third-party home screen launcher. This is one of Android's best features, and it's [something more people should be doing](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-beam-breakthroughs-lighting-know-how-for-video-success/).

[Nova Launcher](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU228118/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher) and [Niagara Launcher](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU228118/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher) are a couple of our favorite home screen launchers. Nova is a highly customizable home screen launcher—it can even [look like an iPhone home screen](https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-propel-your-presence-on-tiktok-strategic-application-of-template-videos/). Niagara offers a completely different type of home screen layout, which is great if you're looking to try something new. Home screen launchers will usually walk you through changing the default launcher, [but it's also easy to do yourself](https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-essential-guide-to-hashtagging-for-game-focused-yt-channels/).

 A major component of the Android home screen experience is app icons. You can easily change the look of all your icons with an "icon pack." There's a huge number of [icon packs available in the Google Play Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU228118/https://play.google.com/store/search?q=icon+pack&c=apps), and they're super easy to use if you already have a third-party home screen launcher.

 Icon packs offer the highest level of customization, but you may not even need one to change up the look of your home screen icons. Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel phones allow you to [match the color of your icons to your wallpaper](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-best-time-to-post-on-ig-for-maximum-reach/). Whenever you apply a new wallpaper, the icons will change to match. It's pretty cool.

##  Change the Wallpaper

 This may seem like an obvious thing to some, but there are plenty of people who never take the time to [change the wallpaper on their Android phones](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/classic-chimes-catalogue-websites-of-worth-for-2024/). It's one of the easiest ways to personalize your device, and on modern versions of Android, it's about more than just the background image on your home screen.

[Samsung Galaxy](https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/split-trim-and-perfect-video-editing-techniques-in-windows-live-movie-maker-for-2024/) and [Google Pixel phones](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/choosing-a-gimbal-for-smooth-drone-photos-and-videos/) support an Android feature called "[Material You](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/plot-craft-guild-bestowed-batch-for-2024/)." Essentially, when you choose a wallpaper, Android pulls colors from it and uses them throughout the phone. These colors appear in the Quick Settings panel, volume controls, system apps, and some third-party apps. So, changing your wallpaper now and then can have a big impact on how your phone feels.

 We've been talking a lot about freshening up the look of the software, but what about your Android phone's physical appearance? You've gotten overly familiar with how it feels in your hand, and the look isn't that special anymore. It's time for a case—or maybe a new case if you were [living the naked phone life](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/unleashing-the-full-potential-of-game-characters-with-voice-alteration-strategies-free/).

 The actual [protective qualities of a phone case are up for debate](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-check-distance-and-radius-on-google-maps-for-your-samsung-galaxy-s24plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), but there's no question a case changes how your phone looks and feels. Slapping on a case of a new material or a different color instantly transforms the device. I'm a big fan of [having multiple cases in your rotation](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/artificial-intelligence-the-next-level-for-bing/) to keep things fresh and to match your situation like you would with a watch band.

 Whether you have an iPhone or an Android phone, it's going to get slower over time. [This is partly your fault](https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/effective-data-sanitization-a-users-guide-to-scheduling-stellar-file-eraser-5-for-windows/) and partly just how technology works. The good news is [there are plenty of things you can do to mitigate the sluggishness](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-free-online-services-for-youtube-images-extraction/).

 Simple things like [restarting](https://location-fake.techidaily.com/3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-apple-iphone-8-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/)and [updating apps](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-here-are-some-reliable-ways-to-get-pokemon-go-friend-codes-for-meizu-21-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) can help. You can also [clear the cache](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-apeak-recorder-reviewed-speed-quality-and-ease-of-use-scored/) and [delete unused apps](https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-ultimate-gear-for-youtube-content-makers/). If you really want to squeak out every last drop of performance, you can [speed up animations](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/approved-decode-your-youtube-preferences-with-these-6-fan-favorite-questionnaires/) and [switch to "Lite" versions of apps](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-easy-to-use-frp-bypass-tools-for-unlocking-google-accounts-on-vivo-y200e-5g-by-drfone-android/). Of course, there's always the option to completely reset the device and start fresh. That's a dramatic step, but it's tough to beat that factory-fresh uncluttered feeling.
