## Discover the New 8BitDo Replica: A Tribute to Classic IBM Model M Keyboards

Even though the IBM Model M not a "real" mechanical keyboard and even though it's several decades old, it still has a certain charm to it that some people still want to keep today. Only problem is that using an original one might prove challenging if you don't have a PS/2 port (the first few models actually had an even older DIN port). Thankfully, 8bitDo is coming through with its own copycat for you to check out.

 8bitDo has just released a new "M Edition" Retro Mechanical Keyboard. As the name implies, it has a similar color scheme and design as the classic [IBM Model M](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/essential-pitfalls-crafting-perfect-text-with-chatgpt/) keyboard. It's not an exact copycat of the older keyboard, and uses the same base design as 8BitDo's earlier [Commodore 64-inspired keyboard](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-foremost-suggestions-premium-iphone-tone-makers/). It has the same palette of beige colors, and a design that resembles that older classic, but really, that's about it. The keyboard feels like your regular run-of-the-mill gaming keyboard with Kailh mechanical switches.

 There's nothing wrong with just being inspired by the older design, and most people will appreciate it, but it might not feel like exactly the same thing as the older keyboard if you're looking for that. The original Model M has a "buckling spring" design instead of being actually mechanicalâ€”the key has a spring inside which, upon buckling after being pressed down, activates a pivoting hammer that's right below and actuates the key. That's an extremely rare design nowadays, with 1:1 copycats being made by companies such as Unicomp. If you're not looking specifically for buckling spring keys and you're okay with your regular mechanical switches, and you still appreciate those retro beige hues in the Model M, then this 8bitDo keyboard might just be what you want.

 Other features include three connectivity modes (Bluetooth, 2.4 GHz, and USB), a volume knob, a hot-swappable PCB, and much more. It's basically as premium as a mechanical keyboard can get. 8bitDo is great at making retro-feeling hardware, as its controllers have shown, so the next natural step was imitating the most beloved retro keyboard out there.

 The keyboard costs $99.99 and it's now available for pre-order at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4QB5HMZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003398&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F8bitdo-latest-keyboard-ibm-model-m-lookalike%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).
