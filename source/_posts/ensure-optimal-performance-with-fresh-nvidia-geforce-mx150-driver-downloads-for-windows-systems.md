## Windows 11/10 Gamers, Boost Your Experience with the Latest Nvidia GeForce Game Ready Driver Downloads

You may find your favorite game cannot bring you a better experience as before. This reminds you to update your GeForce Game Ready driver.

## Why do you need to update the Nvidia GeForce Game Ready driver?

 Driver functions as a translator between your device and operating system. The operating system gives a command to your device, but the device can not understand it. Both system and device don’t actually speak the same language so they need a translator – driver. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices but drivers haven’t, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

This is why most of the problems can be solved by updating drivers.

## 2 Methods to update Nvidia GeForce Game Ready driver

 Here are two methods to update your GeForce Game Ready driver: manually and automatically.

1. **[Manually download from the official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Method 2: Automatically download by Driver Easy

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
