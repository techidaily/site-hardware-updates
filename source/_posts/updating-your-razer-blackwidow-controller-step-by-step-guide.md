### 1\. Manually

 When you plug in your Razer Blackwidow keyboard, your system will install a generic driver automatically so that you can use its most basic functions. However, it can bump into problems sometimes.

 To fix it, you can update its driver either from Razer Synapse or download its legacy driver online and manually install it.

* Download[**Razer Synapse**](https://www.razer.com/synapse-2) 2 or Razer Synapse **[3](https://www.razer.com/synapse-3)**  (supports Razer Blackwidow Elite and Lite, Chroma V2, and Tournament Edition Chroma V2).
* Run the Razer Synapse software, which is a cloud-based device manager that includes advanced configuration settings and driver updates.
* Sign in and locate your keyboard, then update the driver.

**OR**

* Go to **[Razer Support for Standalone Keyboard Drivers](http://drivers.razersupport.com//index.php?%5Fm=downloads&%5Fa=view&parentcategoryid=77&pcid=0&nav=0)**  and locate your keyboard model.
* Download the standalone legacy driver and install it manually.
* Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
