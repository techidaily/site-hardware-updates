 High-fidelity 40mm Neodymium drivers provide sumptuous sound and clarity, with active noise canceling increasing your audio pleasure - especially in noisier environments. Dual batteries enable you to have one battery on charge at all times, essentially giving you infinite battery life, which is a major plus for a wireless gaming headset, and a comfortable headband means you can wear the headset for long gaming sessions without feeling the pain of headband fatigue.

 Oh, and of course, this headset comes with an audio mic for chatting. When combined with SteelSeries' Sonar Software, the mic incorporates AI algorithms to silence background noise to give you crystal-clear communications. The mic also fully retracts into the earcup for a sleeker look when it's not needed.
