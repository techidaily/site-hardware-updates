## Affordable Kiddo Timekeeper: T-Mobile Launches Monthly $12 Children's Smartwatch

T-Mobile is now offering the SyncUP Kids Watch 2, an ultra-affordable smartwatch for children who aren't old enough to own a smartphone. The watch costs $174, but you can get it for free if you open a T-Mobile smartwatch data plan, the cheapest of which is $12 a month.

 As explained by T-Mobile, the [SyncUP Kids Watch 2](https://www.t-mobile.com/devices/iot/syncup-kids-smartwatch) is intended to be a "first piece of tech" for kids under the age of 11\. This isn't a fitness tracker (although it does include a pedometer), it doesn't have social media capabilities, and it can't install apps. In other words, the SyncUP Kids Watch 2 is mainly a tracking and communication device. It provides real-time location tracking and can notify parents or guardians when their child leaves a designated area, such as a neighborhood or school.

 Parents or guardians can also set up a list of approved contacts that may communicate with the SyncUP Kids Watch 2 via call, text. And, in emergencies, children can press a Help Button on the watch to alert both 911 and designated adults.

 A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. So, the SyncUP Kids Watch 2 includes some fun stuff to make kids feel like they're wearing a "real" smartwatch. There are two cameras for taking photos, Bluetooth connectivity for playing music over wireless earbuds, a built-in flashlight, and some simple games. (Parents can remotely disable these distractions by enabling "School Mode" in the SyncUP KIDS app.)

 Notably, the watch's cameras can be used for video calls, though this feature is strictly controlled by the parent or guardian. Video calls may only be performed in the SyncUP KIDS app, so it's not like FaceTime where anyone with the right number can initiate a video call.

 The original SyncUP Kids Watch was known to be fairly durable and long-lasting. I'll go out on a limb and assume that this is true of the new model, too. Customers who are concerned about durability can buy [a case](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=syncup+kids+watch+case&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004352&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Ftmobile-syncup-kids-watch-2-debut%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) for the watch (although none seem to be available for this second-gen model yet), and T-Mobile says that a replaceable screen protector comes preinstalled.

 One thing to note, however, is that the SyncUP KIDS Watch 2 isn't waterproof. T-Mobile calls this model "water-resistant," but the carrier doesn't advertise [IP certification](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-artificer-intelligence-redefines-what-we-perceive-as-real-or-just-a-story/) or specify whether this watch can be submerged. So, don't take it to a beach or a swimming pool.

 T-Mobile customers can order the SyncUP Kids Watch 2 from the [SyncUP landing page](https://www.t-mobile.com/devices/iot/syncup-kids-smartwatch) or the T Life app ([Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004352/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tmobile.tuesdays&hl=en%5FUS&pli=1)/[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/t-life-t-mobile-tuesdays/id1111876388)). Customers who set up a new [smartwatch data plan](https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans/affordable-data-plans/smartwatches), which is required for SyncUP Kids Watch connectivity, get the watch for free through 24 monthly bill credits. The watch costs $174 if you get it without any promotional offers.
