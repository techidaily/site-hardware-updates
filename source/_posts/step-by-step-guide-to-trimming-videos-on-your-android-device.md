 We typically think of cropping as a [tool for photo editing](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-green-thumbs-up-the-best-farming-titles-for-group-playtime/), but it can be used on videos, too. Sometimes the original [aspect ratio](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/e-stock-images-directly-from-trusted-4-youtube-vids/) doesn't fit what you want, especially when [making screen recordings](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-change-lock-screen-wallpaper-on-xiaomi-13t-by-drfone-android/). Thankfully, it's pretty easy to crop videos on Android.

 There are a few different apps you can use to crop videos on Android. The two that will be best for most people are Google Photos and the stock Gallery app on Samsung Galaxy devices. We'll cover both of them.

##  How to Crop Videos with Google Photos

 Google Photos may already be installed on your Android device. If not, you can easily install it from the [Google Play Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU205809/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos).

 First, open the app and select the video you want to crop.

![Select a video.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2022-05-25_14-18-45.png) 

 Tap the screen to bring up the controls and select the "Edit" icon.

![Tap the edit button.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2022-05-25_14-19-34.png) 

 Switch over to the "Crop" tab in the bottom toolbar.

![Select the "Crop" tab.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-05-25_16-42-01.png) 

 Now you have all the cropping tools you'd see for photos. Drag the corners to select the area you want to keep. You can also rotate and adjust the perspective of the video.

 When you're ready to finish, tap "Save Copy" to apply the changes.

 That's it! The original unedited video is still available in your gallery.

##  How to Crop Videos with Samsung Gallery

 Samsung's stock "Gallery" app with some nice video editing tools, including cropping. Find the app on your home screen or app drawer and open it.

 Now you can crop the video just like you would a photo. Drag the grid to select the area you want to keep. You can also flip and rotate the video if you'd like.

 That's all there is to it! Cropping videos is something that wasn't always this easy to do on smartphones. Thankfully, that's not the case anymore. You can crop and do [other basic video editing tasks](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-masterfb-mp4-hacking-facebook-videos-with-ease/) without the need for fancy editors.
