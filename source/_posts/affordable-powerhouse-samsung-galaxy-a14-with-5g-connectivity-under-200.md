 The Galaxy A14 5G is the sequel to last year's A13 5G, and you'd be hard-pressed to notice any differences between the two. Both phones have a MediaTek Dimensity 700 chipset, a 90 Hz refresh rate on the display, a 50 MP (f/1.8) main camera, [a useless 2 MP depth camera](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-bandicam-vs-camtasia-a-comparative-review/), a mostly-useless 2 MP macro camera, and a large 5,000mAh battery. The devices also have a microSD card slot and 3.5mm headphone jack, which are becoming increasingly hard to find on modern smartphones.

 The main difference this time around is a more powerful front-facing camera. Samsung has boosted the front camera from 5 MP to 13 MP, which should improve selfies, video calls, and anything else that relies on the front-facing lens. The display is also slightly larger, at 6.6 inches diagonally (up from 6.5"). Unfortunately, there's still no support for [Wi-Fi 6E](https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/valuating-the-top-video-streaming-apps-for-phones-for-2024/) or 6, just Wi-Fi 5\. 5G is supported on sub-6 GHz bands, though, just like the previous model.

 The Galaxy A14 5G ships with [Android 13](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-country-on-app-store-for-apple-iphone-se-2022-with-7-methods-by-drfone-ios/) out of the box, complete with Samsung's [One UI 5](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/bypassing-google-account-with-vnrom-bypass-for-honor-x9a-by-drfone-android/) customized layer on top. In a rare move for budget Android phones, Samsung is promising "up to two generations of Android OS upgrades and up to four years of security updates."

Best of CES 2023

#####  Samsung Galaxy A14 5G

The Galaxy A14 5G might be the best budget phone under $200, with a 6.6-inch screen, Samsungs feature-packed One UI software, and years of promised updates.

[See at Samsung](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Fphones%2Fgalaxy-a%2Fgalaxy-a14-5g-64gb-unlocked-sm-a146uzkdxaa%22target%3D%22_blank) 

 Samsung's guarantee means the phone should receive updates to Android 14 and Android 15 whenever they become available (presumably in 2023 and 2024, respectively), and system security updates for 4 years. That's still not great, but it's better than just about every other new phone in this price range -- you can [get a used second-gen iPhone SE for around $200](https://swappa.com/listings/apple-iphone-se-2nd-gen/unlocked) that might last longer.
