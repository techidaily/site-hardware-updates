Taking a bit of a redesign from the 2023 models, the latest Asus ROG Zephyrus laptops have dropped a lot of the gamer aesthetic and ditched some of the extravagant RGB elements for a more refined look. With the aluminum chassis, this laptop looks more like a MacBook than a gaming laptop, but it still packs the hardware for playing your favorite games.

 Inside the ROG Zephyrus G14 is AMD's Ryzen 9 8945HS processor with eight cores and 16 threads, a 4 GHz base clock, and 5.2 GHz boost clock. Powering the graphics is Nvidia's RTX 4060 GPU which has 8GB of dedicated VRAM. Other hardware specs include 16GB of 6400 MHz LPDDR5X memory and a 1TB SSD for your operating system and games library.
