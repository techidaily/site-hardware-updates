3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

 After installing the latest graphics driver, restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

### Option 2: Install the graphics driver manually

 It takes time and computer skills to install drivers manually and correctly. If you’re a tech-savvy user, you can try the following steps to install the latest UHD graphics driver on your own.

 If your PC is having persistent display issues, we recommend you use a[third-party driver updater](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . A professional tool not only updates the driver on your PC, it also_fixes_ those that are either broken or missing altogether.

1. Go to[Intel Download Center](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html) . Select**Graphics** .
