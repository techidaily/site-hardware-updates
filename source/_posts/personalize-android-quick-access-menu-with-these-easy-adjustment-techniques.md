 Swiping down from Android's menu bar twice reveals the "[Quick Settings" panel](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-lava-blaze-2-5g-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/) with tiles you can toggle with one tap. Want to hide some of these settings, move them around, or add new ones? You can do that.

 The Quick Settings panel is something that often looks drastically different depending on your [Android device](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/hot-takes-highlight-twitters-trending-topics-for-2024/), but the functionality is basically the same. We'll show you how it looks on a Google Pixel phone and [Samsung Galaxy phone](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-connecting-consciously-with-content-craftsmen-of-your-realm-for-2024/).

 The tiles at the top of the screen are in the Quick Settings area. You can touch and hold a tile to drag it around to a new spot or drag it to the bottom section to remove it. Lift your finger to drop the tile.
