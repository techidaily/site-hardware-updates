 You probably keep a close eye on how much battery is left on your phone every day—that's what we commonly call battery "life." But for the longevity of your phone, battery "health" is much more important. We'll show you how to check it on a Samsung Galaxy phone.

 Battery health is essentially a way to measure the performance of your battery over time. When you get a brand new phone, the battery is in pristine condition and will last as long as it's rated for. However, over time, it degrades, and you may notice the battery dying faster every day. So, let's take a look.

##  Check Battery Health on a Samsung Galaxy Phone

 Samsung is one Android manufacturer that includes a method for checking battery health. It does require an app, but it's an app that is most likely already on your phone. If you don't have the Samsung Members app, you can [download it from the Play Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003023/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.voc&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US).

 First, let's swipe down from the top of the screen to reveal the Quick Settings tiles. Tap the gear icon to open the Settings.
