 Portable power stations are an excellent accessory to have in case of an emergency, to charge gear while camping, or being off the grid. Here are all the features I look for when buying one, and you should, too.

 My older power stations take nearly seven hours to charge fully and [lack USB-C charging ports](https://windows11.techidaily.com/breaking-through-qbittorrent-lag-a-windows-guide/) and advanced features. If I buy a new one from a reputable brand, I want improvements in all those areas and inside one device. Technology has changed a lot, and there are more models than ever. So, make sure you [buy one that's capable](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/easy-tutorial-downloading-and-installing-latest-xp-pen-drivers/) and future-proof.

##  A Big, High-Quality Battery

 The first thing you'll want to decide is how much battery capacity you need from a portable power station. Unless you need something ultra-portable, I suggest nothing smaller than a 500Wh model.

 Sure, a little 20,000mAh [power bank can charge your phone](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/two-ways-to-track-my-boyfriends-zte-nubia-z60-ultra-without-him-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) a few times, but a 500W portable power station is way better. Or something like [my 2,000W Anker 767](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-android-unlock-code-sim-unlock-your-infinix-hot-40-phone-and-remove-locked-screen-by-drfone-android/), which is packed with power. Additionally, that Anker 767 can surge to 3600W, enough to power appliances, a fridge, and more, and that's a big deal.

 Then, along with capacity, you'll want to check the battery type. For example, some older models (or cheap no-name brands) use lithium-ion battery technology, which won't hold a charge very well after a few years and 600-800 recharge cycles. Look for a power station with a [newer LiFePO4](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/detailed-syma-x8c-assessment/) (or LFP) battery. It'll be a little heavier and more expensive, but it'll last for over 3,000 recharge cycles (nearly 4x), powering your gear for years to come.

##  Multiple Charging Options and USB-C

 As technology evolves, more brands offer massive power stations with LFP batteries inside. While that's great, you'll still want to ensure all that power gets utilized to its full potential.

 I won't buy a portable power station that doesn't have at least 3-4 regular 120V AC outlets to plug in household items or extension cables. I also want a 30/50A RV outlet. More importantly, I want one with several high-output USB-C ports. We recently [reviewed the massive UGREEN PowerRoam](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-iphones-high-dynamic-range-step-by-step-guide/), which has four USB-C ports with different output ratings. Run a laptop with the 140W or 100W USB-C ports, or charge your phones, tablets, drone battery, and gear with the other two 45W fast-charging USB-C ports.

 You don't want a portable power station with only a few weak USB-A and USB-C ports; you want one that's future-proof. Considering almost everything runs on USB-C these days, the more the merrier. Anker even has a new unit that can [run RVs and charge EVs](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-enhancing-user-experience-with-timecodes-in-videos/).

##  A Built-In Lantern or LED Light Bar

![Anker PowerHouse LED light](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/f51f38af.jpg) 

Cory Gunther / How-To Geek

 One of my favorite features in almost every Anker portable power station is the built-in LED light bar. I often run string lights from the USB port around camp, charge my gadgets, and do other things with mine. But at the night's end, the 3-stage lightstrip doubles as a lantern.

 A small built-in light is the perfect soft lighting for inside a tent, not to mention it'll be hugely helpful during a power outage at home. We've all had the power go out during a summer storm, and with a power station, I can keep the fridge running and have light without searching for a flashlight. Anker's recent C800 power station has both an LED bar and a [telescopic light pole](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-unlock-visual-storytelling-potential-with-snapchat-edits-for-2024/) stored inside the top of the unit. Now that's useful.

 While some brands don't offer lighting, others (Like Jackery and EcoFlow) have small built-in LED bulbs or go above and beyond to ensure you have light when you need it most.

##  Fast Charging the Battery Itself

 Having a ton of ports for charging or a built-in light is great, but none of that matters if your portable power station isn't fully charged or takes forever to juice up.

 Many older or cheaper units can take 5 to 7 hours to recharge using the huge charging brick in the box. If you get a severe weather alert on your phone and run to ensure your power station has enough battery, you may not have time to top it off.

 So, if you're in the market for a new portable power station, find one with fast charging, which is typically a newer model with an LFP battery. Many options from EcoFlow, VTOMAN, and Anker can charge from 0 to 100 in about an hour. Even if you lose power during a storm before it reaches 100%, having a 1500W unit with 80% is better than nothing and can make a world of difference in an emergency.

##  Remote App Control and Other Goodies

Anker

 High-end models are packed with the latest technology, which helps differentiate them from the rest. Here are a few other features to look for. Get one with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, which offers [remote app control](https://www.ecoflow.com/us/app) and software upgrades to improve the experience over time. It's wonderful to be able to turn it on remotely, toggle the LED light, or control each charging section.

 Another benefit of power stations is the ability to go completely off-grid, where you can recharge the device using [solar panel chargers](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-ae-integrating-custom-typefaces/). Additionally, look for a model with expansion add-on battery options in case you outgrow your initial power needs. Bigger power stations also come with wheels or suitcase-style handles for easy transportation.

 You'll want a portable power station that fits your needs and budget. If you're after something for emergencies or RV usage, get a big battery with tons of power and a 30A or 50A RV plug. If you want portability, get something smaller or one with wheels. I want one with more power than I need, built-in lighting, a companion app, and quick charging —all of which are features you should want, too.
