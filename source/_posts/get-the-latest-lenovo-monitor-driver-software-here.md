6. Once the installation file is downloaded, double-click the file to run it and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

After the process has been completed, restart your computer.

### Option 2: Update your Lenovo monitor driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Lenovo monitor driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.
