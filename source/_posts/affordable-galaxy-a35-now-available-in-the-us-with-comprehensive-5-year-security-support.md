## Affordable Galaxy A35 Now Available in the U.S. with Comprehensive 5-Year Security Support

The Galaxy A35 is one of Samsung’s latest budget phones, and last month the company confirmed it was coming to the United States. Now you can actually buy it.

 The Galaxy A35 5G is [now available to purchase from Samsung’s online store](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-a35%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-a35-5g-128gb-unlocked-sm-a356ulvaxaa%2F) as a carrier-unlocked device. It’s priced at $400, and you can get up to $150 off with a valid device trade-in. There’s also an optional 30% off deal for the Galaxy Buds FE when you buy a Galaxy A35, dropping the price of the wireless earbuds from $100 to $70.

 The Galaxy A35 is a standard budget Android phone, with a 6.6-inch 120Hz AMOLED display, 128GB of internal storage, 6GB of RAM, a 5,000mAh battery, and IP67 water and dust protection. There are four cameras in total: a 50MP main lens with optical image stabilization, an 8MP ultra-wide camera, a 5MP macro lens, and a 13MP front camera. Samsung didn’t mention the phone’s main chipset, only calling it an “octa-core processor,” but it’s probably the same Exynos 1380 used in the earlier international model.

Samsung

 The phone will ship with Android 14 and One UI 6.1 out of the box. Samsung promises four generations of Android OS updates and five years of security updates. That means the phone should receive Android 15, 16, 17, and 18 once they become available, and critical security updates will continue until sometime in 2029.

 Interestingly, this is the first Galaxy A30 series phone in years to get an official release in the United States. The Galaxy A32 5G [arrived in the US in 2021](https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/07/samsung-has-a-ton-of-new-budget-and-mid-range-phones-coming-to-the-us-this-week-here-are-all-the-details/) for $280, but Samsung skipped a US release for A33 and A34\. The $400 Galaxy A35 is a significant price hike, but now there’s also the [Galaxy A25 5G for $300](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-a25%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-a25-5g-128gb-uscellular-sm-a256uzkausc%2F) and the [Galaxy A15 5G](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-a15%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-a15-5g-128gb-unlocked-sm-a156ulbdxaa%2F) for $200.

 Samsung [previously confirmed](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/mastering-vector-graphics-our-top-10-pics-stores-for-2024/) that it will not bring the Galaxy A55 to the United States. That leaves the Galaxy A35 as the most premium mid-range phone in the US, with the $600 [Galaxy S23 FE](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CD9645MM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002769&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsamsung-galaxy-a35-release%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) as the next step up the ladder.

 You can [buy the Galaxy A35](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-a35%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-a35-5g-128gb-unlocked-sm-a356ulvaxaa%2F) starting today, in either “Awesome Lilac” or “Awesome Navy” colors. The only storage option is 128GB.
