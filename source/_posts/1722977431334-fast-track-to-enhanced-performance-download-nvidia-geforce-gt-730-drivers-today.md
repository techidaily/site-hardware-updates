**Way 2: Update the Driver through Windows Update**
  
Windows Update would recommend new device driver updates. So you can check and install the latest graphics card driver from Windows Update.  
  
Note even if you have Windows Update set to automatically download and install the important and recommended updates, it is still possible that the driver updates won’t be installed automatically. This would happen if they are under Optional Updates. In this case, you need to install the driver updates manually.

1\. Open[Control Panel](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/).
