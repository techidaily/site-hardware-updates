You can fit two 360mm radiators simultaneously inside the case, so there's plenty of opportunity to upgrade your cooling and case layout to your specifications.

For easy installation, the power supply is installed through the back of the case and a thought-out cable route on the rear of the motherboard tray keeps everything nice and tidy.
