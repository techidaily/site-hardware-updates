## 2 ways to get the RTX 3060 Ti driver

**[Option 1: Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-driver-for-windows-10-8-or-7/#option1)**  – This is probably the quickest and fastest way to get driver updates. All it takes are a few clicks.

**[Option 2: Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This requires a certain level of computer knowledge. You can choose to install manually if you’re a tech-savvy user.
