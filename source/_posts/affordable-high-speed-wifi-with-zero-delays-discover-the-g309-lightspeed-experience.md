## Affordable High-Speed WiFi with Zero Delays - Discover the G309 Lightspeed Experience

A fancy lag-free wireless gaming mouse for less than $100\. That's the sales pitch behind Logitech's new G309 LIGHTSPEED, a mouse that packs some impressive features behind its $80 price tag.

 LIGHTSPEED is a wireless connectivity solution for competitive gaming. It delivers a 1000Hz polling rate with ultra-low latency input, effectively matching the performance of a wired mouse while retaining the convenience of a wireless design. Most other LIGHTSPEED mice cost $100 or more, so it's good to see this technology in a relatively affordable mouse.

 That said, LIGHTSPEED connectivity is one of many premium features in this mouse. Logitech filled the G309 with hybrid optical-mechanical switches, which provide the performance of a traditional optical switch without losing the crisp click of mechanical hardware. The company's HERO 25K sensors, which track at 400 IPS and offer a sensitivity up to 25,600 DPI, are also featured here.

 The G309 lasts for 300 hours on a single AA battery (or 600 hours in Bluetooth mode). However, you don't _need_ to use a disposable battery, as the mouse is compatible with Logitech's [POWERPLAY Wireless Charging System](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mouse-pads/powerplay-wireless-charging.943-000109.html). Using the POWERPLAY mat brings the mouse's weight down from 86 grams to 68 grams.

 If you own a LIGHTSPEED keyboard, the G309 can piggyback off of its USB receiver, thereby cutting down on the number of USB ports that you need to use. Of course, the G309 features optional Bluetooth connectivity, so you don't _need_ to sacrifice one of your USB ports (going into Bluetooth mode kind of defeats the purpose of a low-latency LIGHTSPEED mouse, but it's certainly an option).

 I should point out that this isn't _the_ most affordable LIGHTSPEED mouse. Logitech's [G305](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g305-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-mouse.910-006020.html#buy-g305-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-mouse) costs just $60, although it lacks many of the features that we see in the new G309\. As a quick side note, I'd like to give my condolences to G305 owners who are now tempted to upgrade to the G309â€”I see you freaking out on Reddit.

 You can purchase the [G309 LIGHTSPEED](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g309-lightspeed-gaming-mouse.910-007197.html) mouse today for $80\. It comes in black and white colorways. Grip stickers, a AA battery, and a LIGHTSPEED USB receiver are included in the box.
