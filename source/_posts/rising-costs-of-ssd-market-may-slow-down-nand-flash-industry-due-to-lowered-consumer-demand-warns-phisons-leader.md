## Secure Your Data with the Powerhouse: Get Samsung's 990 EVO ^2 TB SSD for a Remarkable Low of Only $129

Today at[Amazon](https://tools.techidaily.com) , the[Samsung 990 EVO 2TB SSD](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45723&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CRC7H66Z%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomshardware-us-5329609684539675766-20) is discounted to one of its lowest prices ever. It debuted with a somewhat unreasonably high MSRP of $239, so it's exciting to see it listed for a price as low as $129\. This SSD is notable compatibility-wise because it can work with PCIe 4.0 x4 and PCIe 5.0 x2 interface modes. So far, no expiration has been confirmed for the discount so we're not sure for how long it will be offered at this price.

 We took the opportunity to review the[Samsung 990 EVO 2TB SSD](https://tools.techidaily.com) in February of this year and found it to be an overall good experience, rating it at 3 out of 5 stars. The performance was well within expectations although it didn't stand out as particularly remarkable thanks to its high price tag. It was also somewhat lacking in power efficiency but its performance and flexibility made for a more worthy investment.
