## The Ultimate Runner's Guide: Top-Rated Earphones for Your Workouts - A Tech Reviewer's Picks

### Key Takeaways

* Sony Linkbuds excel for running with open design, easy controls, and lightweight build, but lack robust bass.
* Bose Ultra Open Earbuds offer rich sound and secure fit, but are pricey.
* Other options like Beats Fit Pro, AirPods (3rd Gen), and Jabra Elite 8 Active offer various features, but may not excel in all aspects for running.

 There are a lot of good earbuds on the market, but what are the best ones to use for running? I lace up my running shoes for a little over 100 miles each month and use a lot of different earbuds as How-To Geek's Reviews Editor. I’ve found two pairs that are my current favorites.

##  Grading Earbuds on a Running Curve

 With earbuds used for work or travel, the priority is more on pristine audio quality or noise cancellation. For road running, the priorities of fit, playback controls, and awareness of your surroundings rank much higher than they otherwise would. In the context of running, I'm considering fit and whether they can stay in (or on) my ears. I'm thinking about physical controls and whether it’s easy to skip tracks or answer a call while in motion. Also key, of course, is how they sound. I’m always looking for the most open design that also produces a good sound—a tall task.

##  Sony Linkbuds

 The [Sony Linkbuds](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-perfect-your-iphone-photo-craftsmanship-with-top-10-design-tips/) have a distinct design with a circular shape and a hole right in the middle. The physical cutout means they don’t isolate you from your surroundings. That’s a big win while running on the road and I love that they don’t feel like they’re plugging up my ears when sweat starts to creep in.

 Another thing I love about the Linkbuds is how they can utilize a unique control input. I can double or triple tap on my cheek, around my ear, to pause or skip songs. I don’t have to try and reach for a small touch target while moving. The Linkbuds are also incredibly lightweight and come in a tiny case. They’re really easy to travel with if you like to run while on vacation.

 Although great for running, there have been times I felt like I could use a little more volume out of them while out on the road. That’s a culprit of the openness. Similarly, the robustness of the bass and sound quality suffers a bit at the hands of extreme awareness. Most of the time I’m listening to podcasts or audiobooks so I don’t mind a lack of deep bass. Music still sounds strong, but especially while road running, that aspect is not the earbuds’ primary strength. Since the Linkbuds have been out for a while you can usually find them on sale for [under $130](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-LinkBuds-Wireless-Headphones-Open-Ring/dp/B09QNQ45BK?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003890&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fi-review-tech-here-are-my-favorite-earbuds-for-running%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority).

##  Bose Ultra Open Earbuds

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 On the other side of the coin, the [Bose Ultra Open Earbuds](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-revolutionize-your-photos-pro-level-pixlr-techniques/) have a remarkably deep and rich sound, while also keeping your ears open and free. That’s because the earbuds actually clip onto the side of your ear. It’s a fantastic design that’s comfortable and secure and allows for controlling media with a physical button.

 If you refuse to compromise on an open design and the best audio quality, these are the ones to buy. The biggest issue isn't with performance, it's that they’re not cheap. The [$300 retail price](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Immersive-Wireless-OpenAudio-Awareness/dp/B0CPFV77W4?crid=3AI8XND3M5VLH&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.586M6eDTEdvQ%5FVM7xZ1usaakvyLg2rMZ1J2SxpBWAM6hZ5QDXWorUVT%5Fjmybj3wl7oEjgRrnr5q0zKm35lxLCIUmdGhg5UQJkuifP2oc9bLIvKr-w8nrpfyRTiBy%5FvssGr1k6xL-oofMufiqxQLlsmlik5hZfvbKn1rXeTdJNHBQA-K35FiOB7rN6Y8xEv23%5FF8jyBFEB9XqaYHLdOC-5%5FPUntXwcHsJLKe61XDtb218k7qtvMbK0cLj0yav9pAVOAUBFEW%5FjnIw4wpPZ7IP6N0XR6rfNktwPfZnGTIcFho.IU9ZF9cxZMk1%5Fj5niL8iz9T6gGVHXPtCwRIE1hX3vi8&dib%5Ftag=se&keywords=bose+ultra+open+earbuds&qid=1719597850&s=electronics&sprefix=bose+ultra+%2Celectronics%2C140&sr=1-1-spons&sp%5Fcsd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003890&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fi-review-tech-here-are-my-favorite-earbuds-for-running%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is a lot more than most people spend on nice ANC headphones, let alone on earbuds for running.

 For all their benefits, there are a few negatives I’ve discovered along the way. I’ve had intermittent issues with the earbuds charging because of the way the pins in the case contact the earbuds. I’ve also had trouble making calls with these when they’re directly connected to my Apple Watch. Those concerns probably won’t apply to most people, but they’re worth noting nevertheless.

##  Some Other Options

Close 

* I’ve used the newest [Sennheiser Momentum Sport](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-wiped-videos-on-infinix-note-30-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-video/) earbuds but didn’t care for their larger size, sensitive touch controls, or heart rate sensor.
* I'm a big fan of the [Beats Fit Pro](http://www.amazon.com/Beats-Fit-Pro-Cancelling-Built/dp/B0BTK5XPF6?crid=3HMANOITMGNER&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.RdzxC8KklF3r4wD7FDEYROboXmNl6roELqot1j2Q85SWmefyG76ftjnD5OYhfJLvD0qnlU79bddbdDAnz15SXK0WvwEoMUyN%5F1VSoiJyUJg%5FjXmzSx4G1pSq6hLzJT8Oi9tplQWbYJ398UmHpwY520uOc82onyGToyETqFQMMhtX%5FkH%5FRNZje5a%5FRWmgfhV36h-7p2UN0Pb11DgYw5uFilVCE0Mtj2ir0cv6GMmjVKihaf5FDnAoaWpfkSqSrtmO%5Fn4YeKsPoF8%5FXVrw530KsO5%5FSBSDJcJqvc0CpzGHm4o.eDbpJ7rEzeYHd4JvPlB1G1RVHESGud6PiWTkWx8CAjs&dib%5Ftag=se&keywords=beats+fit+pro&qid=1719540385&s=electronics&sprefix=beats+fit+pro%2Celectronics%2C228&sr=1-1-spons&sp%5Fcsd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003890&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fi-review-tech-here-are-my-favorite-earbuds-for-running%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) because of their rubber wingtips. They might be ideal for running at the gym on a treadmill when you _do_ want to isolate yourself more.
* If I could only have one pair of earbuds I needed to use for running and everything else I'd probably pick the AirPods (3rd Generation). They will feel loose and potentially insecure for some people though.
* I don’t like running in over-the-ear headphones, but if you do, the [Beats Solo 4](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ify-your-path-to-youtube-short-mastery/) clamp tight and have a nice sound.
* The [Anker Soundcore Aerofit Pro](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/in-2024-analyzing-best-days-for-highest-audience-retention/) earbuds have an open-ear design but were a little bulky for my liking.
* The [Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses](https://fox-that.techidaily.com/safari-on-iphone-running-slow-learn-how-to-make-it-zoom-ahead-in-just-4-steps/) sound great, have decent controls to use while running, and even have a camera built in for snapshots without your phone. The problem with the sunglasses version is that they don’t work to run at night, at the gym, or even when it's overcast or raining. The transitional lens version might be the best bet if you’re set on using these.
* The [Jabra Elite 8 Active](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/best-3-tecno-spark-20c-emulator-for-mac-to-run-your-wanted-android-apps-drfone-by-drfone-android/) (and Gen 2 variant) are made to be tough for people who destroy their earbuds. I like nearly everything about them except my ears didn't hold them well. Also, [Jabra is getting out of the earbuds business](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/avoid-complexity-top-5-free-tools-for-effortless-gif-to-video-transformation/).
