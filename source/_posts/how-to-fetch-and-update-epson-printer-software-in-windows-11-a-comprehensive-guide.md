 It means that Windows cannot locate the latest version of the graphics card driver for you, so you might need to consider an alternative to get your graphics card driver updated.

 1) Go to **AMD support** website. Scroll down a little bit to locate**Radeon HD 7000 series** section. Then choose the operating system that you are with accordingly. We choose **Windows 10 (64-bit)** .
