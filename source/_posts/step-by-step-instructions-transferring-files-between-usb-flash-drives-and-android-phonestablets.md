 We typically think of transferring files to a phone by using a physical USB cable or sending them through the internet. Those methods work fine, but there are advantages to [using a USB flash drive](https://win-forum.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-leaders-of-digital-engagement-facebook-twitter-instagram-and-youtube-insights/). Think of it like a mini [external hard drive](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-understanding-and-executing-photo-gender-modification-across-platforms-for-2024/) for your phone.

 Android phones don't have full-size (Type-A) USB ports. ["Dual drive" USB stick](https://amazon.com/dp/B07YYJRXQR?tag=htg-v2-2k61a59-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU222184&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F129800%2Fhow-to-use-usb-drives-with-android-phone-or-tablet%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) with both Type-A and Type-C connectors are becoming more popular and can be used as flash drives for Android devices. However, there's a good chance you have an ["old school" Type-A USB drive lying around](https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/effortlessly-share-twitters-visual-media-to-instagram-for-2024/).

 Thankfully, essentially every [Android phone](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/hot-takes-highlight-twitters-trending-topics-for-2024/) and [tablet](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/16757146-updated-bite-sized-video-knowledge-now/) on the market has a [USB-C port](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/navigating-lenovo-screen-capture-tools-effortlessly/). All you need to use a [Type-A USB drive](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-exploring-the-full-features-sony-fdr-x1000-model/) with a USB-C port is an affordable adapter.

##  How to Access a USB Drive on Android

 Now that we've got your USB drive connected to your phone or tablet, we can access the contents. The following screenshots were taken with a Samsung Galaxy smartphone—the precise location of some menus/options and the text might vary slightly on your device.

 After you plug in the drive, a notification will appear with the message: "USB storage added" or the name of the drive.

##  How to Transfer Files From Android to a USB Flash Drive

 Transferring files from your Android device to the USB drive can be a bit tricky. Some file manager apps don't support it. We'll be using Samsung's built-in file manager, called [My Files](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU222184/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.myfiles&hl=en%5FUS).

 With your USB drive plugged in, find a photo, video, or another file to transfer. Select the file—or multiple files—by tapping and holding.

![Samsung Galaxy Android File Manager My Files Selected](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/samsung-galaxy-android-file-manager-my-files-selected.jpg) 

 In the bottom part of the screen, a quick actions menu will appear. Tap the "Move" button.

 The menu will then change to two options: "Move here" and "Cancel".

![Samsung Galaxy Android File Manager My Files Move Menu](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/samsung-galaxy-android-file-manager-my-files-move-menu.jpg) 

 Open the folder on your USB drive you'd like to move the file to, then tap "Move here."

 That's all there is to it! You can use this same method in reverse to move files from your USB drive to your Android device as well.

 Many Android devices no longer come with SD card slots, but a handy adapter and a [nice USB drive](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-roadmap-how-to-make-your-covers-shine/) are all you need to regularly move files off your phone for more storage space. If you do this a lot, it's probably worth grabbing a ["dual drive" USB stick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YYJRXQR?tag=htg-v2-2k61a59-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU222184&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F129800%2Fhow-to-use-usb-drives-with-android-phone-or-tablet%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) to make your life easier.
