### **Option 2: Update your Canon driver manually**

 Canon keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to Canon’s official website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

Before heading to download the latest driver package from **Canon**  ‘s official website, we’ll first have to uninstall the old driver first. To do so:

1. Go to **[Canon’s official website](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home)** , type **Canon MF4770n**  in the box, and press   **Enter** .
2. Check out**DRIVERS & DOWNLOADS** under the**Support** section.
3. Type**the name** of your Canon product and click**Go** .
