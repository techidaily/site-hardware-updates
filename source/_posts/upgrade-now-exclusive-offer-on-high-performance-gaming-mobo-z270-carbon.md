### Option 1 – Update the driver manually

**Killer** keeps updating their wireless adapter drivers. To get them, you need to visit the **[driver download page](https://support.killernetworking.com/knowledge-base/installing-drivers-using-device-manager/)**  of Killer or simply go to the official website of your computer manufacturer such as Dell to look for the correct driver online.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver. If it doesn’t make sense to you, you may refer to **[this post](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and learn how to install the drivers manually.
