 In this post, we’re going to show you 2 safe and easy ways to help you get the latest driver for your **Brother MFC7360N** printer.

## Choose the way you prefer

 Both methods below work in **Windows 10** , **8** and **7** . You may not have to try both; just decide if you want to do it manually or automatically and take your pick:

1. [**Update your Brother MFC7360N driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your Brother MFC7360N driver automatically (Recommended)**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Update your Brother MFC7360N driver manually

**A WORD OF WARNING** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

 According to Brother’s official website, we’ll first have to uninstall the older driver first. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press   **the Windows logo key  ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**  and **R**  at the same time. Then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click   **OK**  .
