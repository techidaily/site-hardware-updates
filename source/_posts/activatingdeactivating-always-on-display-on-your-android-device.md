### Key Takeaways

 On Samsung phones, you'll head into Settings > Lock Screen > Always On Display and turn on the toggle. On Pixel phones, navigate to Settings > Display > Lock Screen and turn on "Always Show Time and Info."

 The always-on display on your Android phone ensures you can see basic information like the current date and time, weather alerts, missed call notifications, and similar details at all times. You can turn this feature on and off anytime you want on your Android phone. Here's how.

##  What Is an Always-On Display?

 If you aren't familiar with the always-on display feature, it's basically a feature that keeps notifications and other basic information always visible on your phone's screen, even if you've [turned the screen off](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-10-free-youtube-thumbnail-downloaderssavers-online-download-youtube-thumbnail/). This means, you can see those items without [unlocking your phone](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-tweeted-timeline-capture-securing-your-social-media-videos/), or even touching it, which is handy in many cases.

 This feature doesn't cause any burn-in issues, as manufacturers often do thorough testing before rolling out such features. With that said, if your phone didn't come with an always-on display feature and you've obtained the feature by [rooting your phone](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-grasping-the-basics-of-telegram-marketing-strategies/) or [installing a custom ROM](https://win11.techidaily.com/overcoming-windows-image-failure-error-0x80780119/), we don't recommend turning it on. Since your device wasn't built with always-on in mind, [your phone's screen may have issues](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-approach-to-online-advertising-mastery/).

###  Does Always On Display Use More Battery?

 In various testing performed by various sites, like [DXOMARK](https://www.dxomark.com/always-on-display-how-does-it-affect-battery-life/), it's been found that [always-on display does indeed use more battery juice](https://win-forum.techidaily.com/guide-step-by-step-process-to-refresh-your-windows-10-driver-software/). This is because the phone needs to light up various [pixels](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-review-for-dji-fpv-goggles/) on the screen to display information.

###  How Can I Improve Battery Life While Using Always On Display?

 Some Android phones allow you to customize the always-on display, so the display is only triggered when you have a new notification.
