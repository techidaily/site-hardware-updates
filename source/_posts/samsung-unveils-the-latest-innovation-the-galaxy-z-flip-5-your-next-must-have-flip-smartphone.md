## Samsung Unveils the Latest Innovation: The Galaxy Z Flip 5 - Your Next Must-Have Flip Smartphone

Flip phones used to be a thing of the past, but with the rise of [foldable screens](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/step-beyond-reality-reviewing-lgs-virtual-vision-for-2024/), they're now around yet again. The Galaxy Z Flip lineup brings all the might of Samsung's [flagship smartphones](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/hot-takes-highlight-twitters-trending-topics-for-2024/) to an easily pocketable, flip phone form factor. Now, the newest Samsung flip phone is here: meet the Galaxy Z Flip 5.

 Samsung has just announced the Galaxy Z Flip 5 as one of its two 2023 foldables — the other being the Galaxy Z Fold 5 — during the company's Unpacked conference. And it's bringing with it a slew of improvements.

 The one you'll immediately notice is the new, greatly expanded cover screen. While the cover screen in the Galaxy Z Flip 4, its predecessor, takes up just a small strip alongside the camera, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 has a much bigger one that covers almost the entirety of the top half of the phone. This will come very in handy if, for one, you want to use the cover screen as a viewfinder for taking a selfie with the main camera.

 That cover screen is 3.4 inches, and the main foldable screen (which is the one you'll use most of the time) is 6.7 inches. The phone is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, just like the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the older Galaxy S23 smartphone range. It also comes with up to 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.

 In terms of battery, the phone is coming with a 3,700 mAh cell which should keep things running well throughout your day — it's identical to the Z Flip 4's battery, so don't expect a lot of improvement in that department. And we're also getting 25W charging, which is far from being the fastest charging standard out there, but it gets the job done. Finally, the phone is coming with One UI 5 (based on Android 13) out of the box, with Samsung promising up to four major OS updates and five years of Android updates in general.

 The Galaxy Z Flip 5 is available for pre-order starting at $999 for the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The phone comes in Mint, Graphite, Cream, and Lavender options, and ships by August 11th, so make sure to [grab yours now](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3D2QzUaswX1as%26mid%3D47773%26u1%3DUUhtgUeUpU904582%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.samsung.com%252Fus%252Fsmartphones%252Fgalaxy-z-flip5%252F) if this sounds like your next phone.
