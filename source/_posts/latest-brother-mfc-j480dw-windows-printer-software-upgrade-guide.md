### 2: Manual download from the manufacturer’s website

 Manufacturers release updates for their graphics cards quite often. If you’re looking to get the latest driver for your Sapphire graphics card, you can find it on[AMD Support page](https://www.amd.com/en/support) . Search for your product, and make sure to only download the driver that’s**compatible with your Windows Version** . Once you’ve downloaded the driver, you’ll need to install it manually.

### 3: Automatic update (Recommended!)
