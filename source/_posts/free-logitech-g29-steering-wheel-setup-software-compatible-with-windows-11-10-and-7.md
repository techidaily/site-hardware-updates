 If your computer has no Internet, you can use the **[offline scan feature](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy to download & install network drivers **even without Internet** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Launch Driver Easy, then click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
