##  What to Look For in Tech Travel Gadgets

 When shopping around for necessary gadgets to take on your next trip, there are a few things you'll want to consider.

 First, it's important to think about what's necessary for your vacation or business trip---whether for work or play, you'll likely have limited space in your luggage for clunky or heavy tech. Before making any purchases, you'll want to ensure that it's something you'll need while you're away from home. Our list contains things that may be considered necessary for some, but the ultimate decision will be up to you.

 Likewise, size and weight are equally important factors. If you're planning on packing your tech in a carry-on bag, for instance, you'll want to stick to pretty compact gadgets such as a portable charger or a tablet. If you play on checking a bag, you may be able to pack larger items such as an instant film camera.

 Lastly, you'll want to consider your budget. If you're specifically buying a gadget for an upcoming trip, you may not want to spend a lot of cash. However, if you're a frequent flier or road tripper, perhaps it's a good idea to invest in something on the pricier side.

##  Best eReader: [Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-kindle-paperwhite-Signature-Edition/dp/B08B495319?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) 

![Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition displaying lock screen on a couch arm](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/52781622445_3d30805276_o.jpg)

| Pros                                 | Cons                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ 32 gigabytes of storage            | ✗ Have to pay for a monthly Kindle Unlimited subscription |
| ✓ One charge can last up to 10 weeks | ✗ Wireless charger is sold separately                     |
| ✓ Glare-free display                 |                                                           |

 If you're a frequent reader, carrying chunky books can take up precious space in your carry-on or checked luggage. However, the [Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-kindle-paperwhite-Signature-Edition/dp/B08B495319?tag=htgprimedaysite-20), our [top pick for eReaders](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/superior-10-mobile-apps-to-edit-your-face/), eliminates this issue through its 32 gigabytes (GB) of storage and the ability to rent up to 20 titles at a time with Kindle Unlimited.

 The Kindle Paperwhite Signature is hard to argue against—you can charge it via USB-C, with one full battery lasting up to 10 weeks. Additionally, its display is something to write home about. The 300 ppi screen is glare-free, while its warm lighting is adjustable. The front light also automatically adapts to the brightness of your surroundings, making it an excellent option for red-eye flights.

 Although you can use your Kindle without a [Kindle Unlimited subscription](https://www.reviewgeek.com/123380/is-amazon-kindle-unlimited-worth-it/) (an additional $9.99 a month), the accompanying plan provides a free trial and access to thousands of content with no due dates.

 The bottom line? If you've been tossing around the idea of buying an eReader, the $200 Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is your best bet.

| Pros                                     | Cons                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| ✓ Compact size                           | ✗ A bit pricey for an adapter |
| ✓ 4 USB ports, 1 USB-C port, 1 AC socket | ✗ Doesn't convert voltage     |
| ✓ Compatible with most devices           |                               |

 Planning on diving into international waters? The [EPICKA Universal Travel Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/EPICKA-Universal-Travel-Adapter-Power/dp/B078S3M2NX?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) is essential.

 Universal travel adapters allow electronics to power up in different countries. For example, the United States has plugs with two flat vertical prongs, while the United Kingdom has plugs with a top vertical prong and two bottom horizontal ones. A travel adapter ensures you can charge your devices regardless of where you go.

 This option from EPICKA functions explicitly as a multifunctional travel plug. However, it doesn't convert voltage, so you'll want to make sure your devices support 100 to 240 voltage---especially hair dryers and electric razors, which often don't.

 It boasts four USB ports and one USB-C, all of which can be plugged in simultaneously. It covers more than 150 countries, including the U.S., the UK, Australia, and Japan.

 Best of all, this adapter is super compact. You can easily pop it into your carry-on bag for quick access, perfect for unexpected layovers or delays.

 Whether traveling via plane, train, or car, [noise-canceling headphones](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-a-itel-a60-phone-that-is-locked-by-drfone-android/) are something you won't want to go without. For that, we recommend checking out [Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=htgprimedaysite-20), which is one of the best on the market.

 Compatible with both Bluetooth and 3.5mm connections, these headphones are very popular, and their sound quality is a large reason why. You also get some of the best noise-cancellation around, complete with a comfortable design and convenient carrying case.

 Other highlights? There's speak-to-chat technology, which automatically pauses your music when you talk. There's also built-in Alexa, touch sensor control that allows you to skip, pause, and play tracks, multiple device pairing, and two color options: [Black](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) and [Silver](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XSDMT4F?tag=htgprimedaysite-20).

 All of those incredible features come with a hefty price tag, though—at nearly $400, these Sony headphones are a significant investment. However, if you have the cash to spend and want a pair of [noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-sharing-twitch-on-your-fb-page-for-2024/) that will last, these are your best bet.

If you've somehow managed to live without one until now—or you're looking to upgrade your current model—we recommend the [Anker PowerCore Slim 1000](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Ultra-Compact-High-Speed-VoltageBoost-Technology/dp/B07QXV6N1B?tag=htgprimedaysite-20). Priced at less than $30, its impressively slim design can provide multiple charges for iPhones, Android devices, and smaller tablets.

 Perfect for tucking into your carry-on, this Anker charger features [PowerIQ and VoltageBoost](https://deals.anker.com/poweriq) technologies, which ensures that your device is receiving the fastest charge possible. It's also airline-friendly and designed to provide optimal charging to low-power devices, such as headphones and [Bluetooth speakers](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-photo-perfection-highest-rated-phone-tripods/).

 That being said, it does take nearly six hours to charge this gadget to its full capacity, so you'll want to gear this guy up a day or two in advance. Additionally, while there are both [USB-A and USB-C](https://www.reviewgeek.com/53587/usb-explained-all-the-different-types-and-what-theyre-used-for/) ports, cords are not included, so make sure you have those ahead of time.

 A [Bluetooth tracker](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-top-10-best-free-image-overlay-apps-for-android-and-iphone/) is a great gadget, especially when you're away from home. These handy devices can be latched onto essentials such as your bag or wallet. And if you accidentally lose them, your tracker will help you find or keep an eye on them.

 Our favorite? The [Tile Mate](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2XXBFR?tag=htgprimedaysite-20), a compact little gizmo that can be easily snapped onto travel necessities and features a Bluetooth range of up to 250 feet.

 At less than $50 for a pack of two, these trackers are super easy to use and affordable. You download the accompanying Tile app, which will ring your Tile when it's in Bluetooth range (you can also ask a smart home device, like Amazon Alexa or Google Home, to find it for you). There's also a custom QR code on each Tile, so you can be reached if someone finds it and scans the code.

 We also like that the Tile Mate can be used to find your phone. You can double-press the button on your Tile to make your phone ring, even when it's on silent. And, in cases when your Tile is out of Bluetooth range, you can use the app to see its most recent location on a map.

 You'll have to upgrade to Tile's premium plan for added features like Smart Alert and item reimbursement. Additionally, the Tile is battery-powered, so you'll want to ensure it has a fresh battery before jet setting.

 Film cameras are all the rage right now, and this option from Fujifilm, the [Instax Mini 90 Neo Classic](https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Mini-Neo-Classic/dp/B00FR85IRK?tag=htgprimedaysite-20), is no exception. This easy-to-use film camera instantly develops 2.1 by 3.4-inch (53.34mm x 86.36mm) photos.

 In terms of its specs, the Instax Mini 90 is pretty cool. It can automatically detect the brightness of your background or surroundings and will adjust the flash and shutter speed, so you get a great photo every time. Additionally, there's a double exposure mode you can access by pressing the shutter twice.

 While it has great ratings and reviews from buyers, we would only recommend this purchase if you've had your eye on it for a while. The camera itself is pretty expensive, and the added cost of repurchasing film can quickly rack up.

| Pros                         | Cons                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Great ratings              | ✗ Battery life depends on what software you're using |
| ✓ Three play styles          | ✗ Joycons can slip out                               |
| ✓ Up to 9+ hours of playtime |                                                      |

 Having a handheld gaming machine on deck is particularly smart if you're a nervous traveler or get bored easily. These gadgets can help keep your mind and hands occupied while waiting to board a plane or killing time during a layover.

 Our number one pick is the [Nintendo Switch](https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07VGRJDFY?tag=htgprimedaysite-20), the company's latest addition to the handheld gaming universe. The Switch was essentially born to be a versatile device for solo or group play. It features three play styles (handheld, tabletop, and TV mode), and the Joycons easily slip in and out for the latter.

 Other things to love? Depending on what you're playing on the Switch, it has between 4.5 and 9 hours of battery life. It's super lightweight and compact (it weighs in at less than a pound), and the 6.2-inch touch screen is perfect for [collecting coins in Mario](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-rising-viewers-rising-prosperity-the-youtube-route/), making friends in Pokémon, or farming in Stardew Valley. Just make sure to pick up [accessories](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/how-to-make-a-gif-meme/) to make it easier to take the Switch with you on the go.

 The original Nintendo Switch model and its price cousin, the [Nintendo Switch OLED](https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-White-Joy/dp/B098RKWHHZ?tag=htgprimedaysite-20), are a pricier investment, but you can also save $100 and pick up the [Nintendo Switch Lite](https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Blue/dp/B092VT1JGD?tag=htgprimedaysite-20). This budget model is a portable-only device, however, so you won't be able to take advantage of a TV mode.

 If you're a PC gamer, you might also want to look into the [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/), to play your PC gaming library on the go.

 If you're looking for a great tablet to travel with, look no further than Apple's [10th-generation iPad](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLCWFNM?tag=htgprimedaysite-20). The device was updated with a refreshed design that's a lot more modern than the previous model. The larger 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display gives you more room to manage email, surf the web, or kick back with some Netflix.

 The iPad is powered by the A14 Bionic processor, which is the same chip used in the iPhone 12 and still going strong. That means you'll get great performance and battery life, with Apple quoting up to 10 hours of usage on a full charge. There's a USB-C port on the side for charging and connecting accessories like an external drive, and you get amazing stereo speakers.

 What's more, the 10th-gen iPad works with the [first-generation Apple Pencil](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-1st-Generation-Adapter/dp/B0BJLG69QR?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) and the [Magic Keyboard Folio](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Keyboard-Folio-10th-Generation/dp/B0BJLFH8RC?tag=htgprimedaysite-20), making it a great all-rounder tablet pick.

 Typing on a tablet screen can get old quickly, especially if you're used to typing on a physical QWERTY keyboard. If you want to ensure you can get work done on your tablet while you wait at the airport or bus station, the [Logitech K480](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Bluetooth-Multi-Device-Keyboard-K480/dp/B00MUTWLW4?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) keyboard is an awesome option to add to your travel tech collection.

 Affordably priced with tons of amazing reviews, this Bluetooth-capable keyboard lets you connect to three devices at once and, thanks to the switch dial, enables you to switch between them anytime. It's compatible with Windows, Android, Chrome OS, and iOS devices. Plus, the pre-installed AAA batteries can last up to 24 months.

 Although this Logitech gadget is super cool, it doesn't fold up. It features a classic keyboard design, so it could be a slight pain to travel with, depending on how much space you have. Make sure this is something you need before dealing with the potential pain of packing it!

| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| ✓ Compact size          | ✗ Adapters aren't included |

| ✓ Two-year warranty     |                            |

 If consistently good Wi-Fi is a non-negotiable for you, you'll want to snag a travel router before leaving for your trip. We recommend the [TP-Link AC750 Wireless Travel Router](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Wireless-Travel-Router-TL-WR902AC/dp/B01N5RCZQH?tag=htgprimedaysite-20), a reliable option that's small enough to pack. It features five Wi-Fi modes, two of which are specifically designed for great connection on the go.

 The AC750's router mode allows you to connect to a hotel's Ethernet to instantly create a private wireless network and share access across your devices. Meanwhile, you can also choose hotspot mode, where you can enable an outdoor WISP access point to create a private Wi-Fi hotspot in public areas.

 Despite these "private" connections, you'll still want to [use a VPN](https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/disco-elysium-game-crash-woes-heres-how-to-get-back-in-the-groove-on-your-computer/) to protect your information, especially when you're away from home.

 It also has a micro USB-C port that can be used to connect an adapter, portable charger, or laptop. You'll want to note that the router doesn't come with any cords (you will, however, receive a two-year warranty, which isn't too shabby).
