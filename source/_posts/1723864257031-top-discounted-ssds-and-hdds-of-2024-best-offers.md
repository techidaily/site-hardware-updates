 Upgrading your computer's SSD is a game-changer, giving you more performance, more capacity, or both. Whether it's picking up a speedy new boot drive or adding secondary storage that increases your capacity, you can find some amazing deals on the[best SSDs](https://tools.techidaily.com) .

 It's always a great time to find a bargain storage upgrade for your PC or laptop. The result: some really strong SSD deals. We've seen the prices of storage creep up steadily the last year, and now we're seeing fast 2TB SSDs for about $180 and 4TB models for $350\. High-performance drives like the 1TB Samsung 990 Pro, our favorite PCIe 4.0 SSD, are nowhere near its all-time low of $59\.

 But don't be fooled: not every drive is worthy of your money or a place of honor in your PC. That's why we've listed the best SSD deals below. Many of these drives are listed on our[SSD Benchmark hierarchy](https://tools.techidaily.com) so you can see how they stack up to the competition. You can also track the[latest SSD prices](https://tools.techidaily.com) on all the key drives, even if they are not on sale.

### SSD Deals: What to Look For

* **SATA or NVMe:** SSDs either use the SATA or NVMe interface, with the latter being as much as six times faster (or more). All 2.5-inch drives are SATA, but M.2 drives could be either NVMe or SATA interface, though the latter is now rare. If you have a desktop or laptop that was built in the last 5 years, it almost certainly supports NVMe, which is faster. As SATA is old news, most of the best SSD deals are on NVMe drives.
* **2.5-inch or M.2:** Most internal SSDs are either 2.5-inch or M.2 form factor. 2.5-inch drives connect to SATA ports and can replace old-school mechanical hard drives. M.2 drives look like RAM sticks and plug into dedicated M.2 ports. You won't find that many deals on 2.5-inch drives, but they can be useful for bulk storage as many motherboards have a ton of SATA ports but only two M.2 slots.
* **PCIe 3, 4 or 5:** If you're buying an NVMe SSD, you can choose among PCIe 3, 4 or 5 interfaces with speeds increasing from a maximum of around 3,500 MBps sequential reads and writes to 8,000 MBps and 14,000 MBps. At this point, PCIe 4 drives are mainstream and offer the best value. PCIe 5 drives are extraordinarily expensive, require a newer-gen platform that supports them, and also generate a fair amount of heat. We're seeing the best SSD deals on PCIe 4 drives which is the best standard for most people.
* **Capacity:** 2TB seems to be the sweet spot for price and performance, with decent 2TB, PCIe 4 NVMe drives going for around $80 or less and high-performance ones in the sub $130 range. If you can splurge, go for a 4TB drive, which could cost anywhere from $150 for a low-end drive, up to $250 for a high-end one. If you really need to save money, a decent 1TB drive can cost $50 or less. However, the top SSD deals this year are definitely on 2 and 4TB capacities.
