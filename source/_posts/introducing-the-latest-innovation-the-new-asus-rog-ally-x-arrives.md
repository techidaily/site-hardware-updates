## Introducing the Latest Innovation: The New ASUS ROG Ally X Arrives

The Steam Deck spawned a whole fleet of competitors trying to make space in the just-established mobile PC gaming segment, and while none of them saw the success the Steam Deck saw, one stood among the rest: the ASUS ROG Ally. If you didn't buy that device, you might want to check out its successor/revision, which the company has just announced. Meet the ASUS ROG Ally X.

 ASUS' Republic of Gamers (ROG) sub-brand has just unveiled the ROG Ally X ahead of Computex 2024, a new iteration of its [popular handheld gaming console](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/easier-than-ever-simplified-hdr-photography-insights/). The Ally X retains the powerful AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor, so it's more of a revision than an actual successor, but it also introduces several enhancements based on user feedback. Key upgrades include a larger 1TB SSD, expandable via an M.2 2280 slot, and 24GB of LPDDR5-7500 RAM for improved performance in demanding games. The battery life has also been doubled to 80Wh, allowing for extended gaming sessions away from an outlet.

 As far as the external part goes, the Ally X features a redesigned chassis with improved ergonomics, cooling, and connectivity. It has deeper handles, rounded edges, and redesigned buttons and joysticks, all of which make the handheld more comfortable to hold and play on. It also includes two USB-C ports, one of them Thunderbolt-compatible, for connecting peripherals and external GPUs. Thermal management has been improved with new, smaller fans and an additional exhaust vent.

 This is great and all, but writing this up would be irresponsible without pointing out that the ASUS ROG Ally suffered from a slew of hardware issues. The device had a series of hardware and software issues, but most notably, it suffered from a bad overheating issue which caused the console to kill SD cards users put inside them. ASUS is also not known to have the best track record in terms of honoring warranty, although [recent evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJKzKbqxa0A) shows that the company has worked on this. We need to wait and see whether this revised Ally X has improved in these aspects.

 The ROG Ally X will be available for pre-order soon from the [ASUS online store](https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-rog-ally-x-upgraded-windows-handheld-gaming-console/) and other retailers, starting at $799.99.
