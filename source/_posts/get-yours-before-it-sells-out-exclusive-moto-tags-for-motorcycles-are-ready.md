## Get Yours Before It Sells Out: Exclusive Moto Tags For Motorcycles Are Ready!

You can finally buy the Moto Tag tracker. This small AirTags-like tracking device, which initially launched on August 2nd, was not available at third-party retailers until today.

[Moto Tag](https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-PG38C06068-Moto-tag-4-Pack/dp/B0DB2PLDXL/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004688&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fmoto-tag-finally-in-stock%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is the first [ultra-wideband](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-perfect-guide-to-remove-or-disable-google-smart-lock-on-realme-c67-4g-by-drfone-android/) (UWB) precision tracking device to join Android's Find My Device network. While other Android trackers may only provide a rough estimate of their location, Moto Tag can guide you to whatever couch cushion, bag, or gutter it's hidden in.

 You _do_ need a [UWB-enabled smartphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%5Fof%5FUWB-enabled%5Fmobile%5Fdevices) to take advantage of UWB precision tracking (and UWB support won't arrive in Find My Device until the end of 2024). Still, even without this feature, the Moto Tag is pretty impressive. It sports an IP67 rating for sand and water immersion resistance, its CR2032 battery is user-replaceable, and it has an integrated multifunction button that can trigger your camera shutter or perform other automated tasks (great if you keep Moto Tag on a keyring).

#####  Moto Tag

Moto Tag is the first UWB-enabled Bluetooth tracker to join Android's Find My Device network. It features a user-replacable battery, IP67 durability, and a design that's compatible with Apple AirTag accessories.

[$100 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-PG38C06068-Moto-tag-4-Pack/dp/B0DB2PLDXL/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004688&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fmoto-tag-finally-in-stock%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) [See at Motorola](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fmoto-tag%2Fp%3FskuId%3D1167) 

 Interestingly, Moto Tag is compatible with most AirTag accessories. You don't need to wait for companies to [keyrings](https://www.amazon.com/AirTag-Protective-Scratch-Resistance-Accessory/dp/B093333693/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004688&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fmoto-tag-finally-in-stock%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [adhesive mounts](https://www.amazon.com/Elevation-Lab-TagVaultTM-Surface-Adhesive/dp/B09SPD9GJN/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004688&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fmoto-tag-finally-in-stock%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), or [pet collars](https://www.amazon.com/TagVaultTM-AirTag-Dog-Collar-Mount/dp/B09DR2QNQ5/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004688&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fmoto-tag-finally-in-stock%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) for the Moto Tag, as there are already hundreds of options for the AirTag.

 One thing I'll note is that Moto Tag doesn't have a built-in key ring hole—you _need_ to buy an accessory (unless you plan on tossing the tracker in the bottom of your backpack, or whatever). Other Android trackers like the [Chipolo One Point](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-tier-affordable-photo-enhancement-software-online/) are the same price as the Moto Tag but don't _need_ any accessories. Although I would argue that UWB precision tracking makes up for the Moto Tag's lack of a built-in keyring hole.

 You can buy the Moto Tag at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-PG38C06068-Moto-tag-4-Pack/dp/B0DB2PLDXL/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004688&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fmoto-tag-finally-in-stock%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) or the [Motorola web store](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fmoto-tag%2Fp%3FskuId%3D1167). A single Moto Tag costs $29, while a four-pack is $99\. This is the same price that you would pay for an Apple AirTag. For reference, Moto Tag only works on Android, but it can send stalking alerts to iPhone.
