## The Launch of LG's Tandem OLED Production: Revolutionizing Screen Brilliance with a Victory in the Dell XPS Absolutely, Here Are Five Alternative SEO-Friendly Titles that Convey Similar Meanings to Your Original Title

[LG](https://tools.techidaily.com) has begun mass production of its new Tandem OLED laptop display, according to[a press release](https://www.lgdisplay.com/eng/company/media-center/latest-news?contentId=5326) published earlier today. The panel tech represents a generational step forward in display panels, and LG's new variant will see its first use in the Dell XPS 13 2024 laptop.

 Tandem OLED is a panel design that stacks two layers of organic light-emitting diodes on top of one another, creating tandem operation. The pair together can reach higher brightness than traditional[OLED](https://tools.techidaily.com) panels for much less power draw. LG's new laptop panel specifically is advertised as offering double the lifespan of traditional OLED panels, due to its 40% lower power draw. It can also go three times as bright as a standard panel, and supposedly even offers superior durability. The durability boon is a welcome surprise, especially considering an LG Tandem OLED panel is 40% thinner and 28% lighter than existing OLED laptop screens, making it seem potentially weaker on paper.

 We've first seen Tandem OLED displays in the new[M4 iPad Pros](https://tools.techidaily.com) from Apple, which offer 1,000 nits full-screen brightness and 1,600 nits peak HDR brightness. Before this, Tandem OLED displays have seen use in automotive applications; cars have much higher standards for displays used inside, so the cutting-edge of display tech will often be seen in cars first. Their optimal use case is for high-end consumer displays, however, especially those that necessitate long use times like laptops or art displays.

 LG's new mass-produced panel has impressive specs, even for a non-Tandem OLED screen. The 13-inch 2880x1800 touchscreen display has great color accuracy and depth, reaching 100% of DCI-P3 color accuracy and a Display HDR True Black 500 rating, the second-highest rating available for HDR. However, it will be 60 Hz and only come with a peak SDR brightness of 400 nits.

 The LG Tandem OLED panel's first commercial application comes as the highest-tier screen available for the newest[Dell XPS 13](https://tools.techidaily.com) , part of the first wave of[Copilot+ PCs](https://tools.techidaily.com) . The display is a $300 upgrade from a standard XPS 13, the same price as the upgrade to a non-OLED 2K display (though[Dell](https://tools.techidaily.com) locks the Tandem display behind its more expensive higher-RAM variant).
