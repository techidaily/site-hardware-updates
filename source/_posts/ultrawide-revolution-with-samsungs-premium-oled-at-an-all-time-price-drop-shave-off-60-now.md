## UltraWide Revolution with Samsung's Premium OLED at an All-Time Price Drop - Shave Off $60 Now

The Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 is a superwide 49-inch monitor with impressive specs and a more impressive discount. If you want to amalgamate a couple of monitors into just one beautiful OLED screen, then this could well be the solution for you — as long as you have the desk space or a strong monitor arm. This wide monitor also isn't cheap and even with the discount and added coupon will drain almost a grand from your bank account.

 Usually retailing for its MSRP of $1,599, the [Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 (G93SC) is available for $999](<https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45723&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CDQMQQS2%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomshardware-us-9149367012019328651-20>) after being discounted to $1,099 _and_  with an added $100 coupon brings the price down to its lowest-ever price from November of last year.

 What makes this monitor so special is not only its impressive size but also the QD-OLED panel with a ‎5120 x 1440 pixel resolution. With an OLED screen, you're getting a 0.03ms response time, amazing blacks and contrasts, and eye-popping colors. This monitor can also drive a 240Hz refresh rate if your graphics card is powerful enough and with its 1800R curve, the screen will wrap around your vision and promote better immersion in your games.

 One of my favorite features of this monitor is the ability to still treat the monitor as if you have two screens on your desk. The 'Picture-by-Picture' mode splits the screen in half and lets you use two inputs at their native resolution, so you could have your PC and a console connected and view both sources at the same time - a great feature for streaming game content for example. For connectivity, you have 1 x HDMI 2.1 port, 1 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x micro HDMI 2.1, and a USB Hub.
