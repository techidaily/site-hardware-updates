## Microsoft Copilot Now on New Laptops - Browse the Best Selection of Snapdragon Elite X Machines for Immediate Purchase

Several PC manufacturers recently[launched Qualcomm-powered laptops](https://tools.techidaily.com) and many models are hitting store shelves and shipping out from today. These[Copilot+ PCs](https://tools.techidaily.com) come with Arm-based[Snapdragon X chips](https://tools.techidaily.com) featuring a 45 TOPS NPU and have new AI-powered features,[like Paint’s Cocreator](https://tools.techidaily.com) , as well as access to the controversial Windows Recall feature that’s been relegated[to Windows Insiders](https://tools.techidaily.com) only.

 Although these new Copilot+ PCs are only getting a few new features to start with, other third-party apps like Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, DaVinci Resolve Studio, CapCut, and more will use the built-in NPUs on these computers to run AI features locally. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Arm-based processors of these chips means we’re finally getting Windows laptops that can compete with the legendary battery life of Apple-silicon-powered MacBooks.

 So, if you’re in the market for a new Windows laptop and want to get in on the AI bandwagon, these are the Snapdragon X laptops launching today or in the next few weeks.

## Acer Swift 14 AI
