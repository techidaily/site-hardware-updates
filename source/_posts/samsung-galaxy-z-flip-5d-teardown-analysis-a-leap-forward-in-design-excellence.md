## Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5D Teardown Analysis: A Leap Forward in Design Excellence

### Key Takeaways

* Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6 boasts a sleek design, improved camera, and better battery life.
* Samsung took a safe approach with the Z Flip 6, offering minor upgrades but raising prices.
* While the Z Flip 6 may not bring many groundbreaking changes, it excels in build quality, performance, and a camera suitable for everyday use.

 It seems like folding phones are still relatively new, but Samsung is now in its 6th generation, and they're getting better with each release. Unfortunately, the new [Galaxy Z Flip 6](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D64PM7R9/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004310&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) looks identical to last year but packs several notable upgrades over the previous generation. While the competition is heating up, Samsung is getting complacent and raising prices. It might still be the best folding phone for most people.

##  A Very Familiar Design

Close 

 Samsung fixed two of the biggest complaints with this release: the camera and battery life. An upgraded primary 50MP camera matches the prowess of Samsung's flagship Galaxy S24 series, plus there's more RAM, a bigger battery, and the latest Snapdragon processor built with AI in mind. Unfortunately, the phone looks nearly identical to the Z Flip 5 and comes with a $100 price increase.

 The only visible difference between the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and [Flip 5 reviewed on HTG](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-ideal-tools-to-capture-your-pcs-display-on-windows-10-for-2024/) last year is the chrome rings around the camera sensors. Otherwise, you'd never be able to tell the difference. That said, eagle-eyed folding fans will notice the sides are matte instead of glossy and a bit more flat and squared off. Thankfully, it's still comfortable to hold and use, even with one hand. It's largely the same phone with the same cover display and a tiny gap when shut, but it is better on the inside.

 I'm torn on whether to call this complacency by Samsung, or if they've instead found a tried and true design that's stylish, pocketable, and durable. If it's not broken, don't fix it. As a result, almost nothing changed.

 The Flip 6 has the same glass and metal body as before. The hinge feels excellent, and every part of the design looks and feels premium. The hinge is important on a folding phone; I have no complaints here. It's solid yet smooth, doesn't creak or make any noises, and is easy to snap open, set at specific angles, and close with ease. This is a nice phone!

 Also, like all other models before it, the Z Flip 6 is still incredibly slippery. The squared-off sides make it a little easier to hold, but you'll probably want a case or a sticker skin to give you a better grip.

 The phone is not the easiest to open with one hand. While you can slide a finger (and fingernail) between the screen and flick it open with your wrist, I doubt Samsung loves that idea. Plus, I'm afraid my nails will scratch the plastic screen over time. Once it's open, the fingerprint sensor (inside the power button) works well, but I had the occasional issue trying to unlock the phone while it was closed to use the cover screen.

 My only other complaint is that the speaker sounds worse than last year, or the previous Samsung phones I own. It doesn't sound very full and boomy with bass, but you can physically feel it vibrating the back glass and your fingers while holding the phone, and not in a good way.

##  The Inner Screen Is Where Things Shine

 I was happy to see Samsung increase the outer cover screen size over the last few generations. Sadly, with the Flip 6, there are no major changes in terms of size, specs, or experience on the cover display.

 On the outside, it's still 3.4 inches with a 60Hz refresh rate, and while there are better widgets and easier controls, putting apps or making full use of the outside screen is still cumbersome. I shouldn't have to download Good Lock, find some modules, or search for YouTube videos explaining how to put apps on the outside screen. That's a poor experience and something I expected to improve this year. Unfortunately, Samsung made no effort to match the great outside screen experience of the RAZR competition.

![Galaxy Z Flip 6 apps and home screen](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/flip-6-apps-and-home-screen.jpg)

 Thankfully, the inside screen, which you'll use the most, is vastly better than previous generations. Samsung reportedly used more layers for improved durability, and now it gets insanely bright at 2,000 nits of peak brightness. Using this thing outdoors is no problem. The viewing angles are great, and everything looks crisp and clear.

 So far, the center folding crease is less visible than in previous generations, less prone to damage from pokes or pressure, and even [IP48 resistant](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-artificer-intelligence-redefines-what-we-perceive-as-real-or-just-a-story/) to water and small dust particles. You don't need to worry (as much) about dirt getting inside the hinge and damaging the display.

 Essentially, the outside cover screen still needs work, while the screen on the inside is better than ever.

##  Improved Cameras

Close 

 Perhaps the biggest and most welcome upgrade is in the camera department. Camera quality was the biggest complaint when reviewing the Galaxy Z Flip 5\. Its 12MP wide camera wasn't up to the usual Samsung standards, especially at this price point. This time Samsung added a beefy 50MP camera.

 The Z Flip 6's 50MP shooter features 2x optical zoom, 10x digital zoom, and night photography with HDR video support. It's nearly the same great camera experience you get with the Galaxy S24 series, including all the AI enhancements. Aside from that main camera, the rest of the experience is on par with previous Flip models and nothing to write home about.

Close 

 I've included a few sample images, taken outside in varying weather conditions, indoors, or close-ups of my pup. Overall, the results are decent, with sharp details and plenty of contrast. Zooming to 2x or using the front camera delivers fairly decent photos, but it could always be better. Videos are sharp, and Samsung's "Super Steady" and "Portrait Video" modes are as excellent as ever.

 The inner screen still has its usual 12MP camera, which delivers the typical quality of Samsung selfie cameras. However, you're better off closing the phone and using the rear 50MP camera and the cover screen as a viewfinder, as this will yield significantly better results.

##  Software and AI Goodies

 One UI, Samsung's fancy version of Android, is better than ever with One UI 6.1.1, which shipped with the Z Flip 6\. Any Samsung owner will feel right at home with the entire experience. It's easy to use, full of additional features, and gets updated frequently. More importantly, the Flip 6 is guaranteed to get seven years of software support.

 As usual, Samsung delivers tons of customization anywhere and everywhere, some of which flows into the cover screen. I'm sad to report that cover screen customization, or the ability to easily add apps, is still one of this phone's weakest links. It's doable but needs to be more accessible for average users. I'd also love more apps that take advantage of dual-screen mode while partially folded.

![Flip 6 angled playing video](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/flip-6-angled-playing-video.jpg) 

Justin Duino / How-To Geek

 Naturally, the star of the show is [all the Galaxy AI goodies](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevate-your-content-game-with-these-instagram-story-tips/), especially some additional features in the latest version of One UI. There are still Google's Circle to Search, photo enhancements, Interpreter mode, and everything that debuted with the S24 series, but these flagship foldables also have "Drawing Assist" and "Photo Assist." The first one is generative AI, and you can doodle on the screen and use Galaxy AI to create an image from your drawing in several different styles.

 AI doodles are fun, but editing your own photos is even better. The trees by my front door do not exist! That's AI.

Close 

 Photo Assist is similar, yet it's found in the gallery app and uses generative AI to enhance any photo by adding a dog, car, trees, and other items. Scribble on the screen with your finger, and Galaxy AI does a relatively good job of understanding what you want, then spits out several options for you to add to the photo. The trees by the front door are 100% fake, but at first glance, they look normal.

 Samsung's AI did an okay job of understanding my terrible artistic skills, and the results are hit or miss. The plants look real and natural, but when I tried to put a dog by the pool, it thought I wanted a cow or squirrel. Either way, this tool automatically adds an "AI-generated content" watermark to the bottom-left corner of every image.

 Overall, these AI additions are fun, but that's about it. You'll likely use [Samsung's other Galaxy AI features](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/no-displayed-video-fixing-camera-issue-with-sony-a6400/) more often.

##  Battery Life Gets An Upgrade

![Galaxy Z Flip 6 battery stats screen](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/flip-6-battery.jpg) 

Justin Duino / How-To Geek

 Another notable change this year that may persuade older Z Flip 2 or 3 owners to upgrade is battery life. Samsung managed to cram a larger 4,000mAh battery inside the Flip 6, which everyone can appreciate. It's still a phone you'll need to charge daily and may not last as long as the Galaxy S24 Ultra, but it's indeed a good jump from previous generations.

 Performance and battery life have been excellent for everyday tasks, browsing social media, and using AI features. At first, I was worried about the 4,000mAh battery, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well it performed. It certainly lasts longer than the 3,700mAh battery from the Flip 5, but we can also contribute the increased longevity to the Snapdragon Gen 3 chipset.

 You can enjoy up to 25W fast charging, although the charger isn't included in the box. Like most Samsung phones, it went from 0 to 50% in under 30 minutes, quickly got to 80%, and then slowed down for the final bit. It's fast enough, but I wish it matched some of the recent competition or that the 15W wireless charging supported Qi2.

##  Should You Buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6?

![Flip 6 cover display dog glasses](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/flip-6-cover-display-dog-glasses.jpg) 

Justin Duino / How-To Geek

 I've toyed with folding phones a bit and was quick to dismiss them, as I'm sure many of you do. After spending two weeks with the [Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D64PM7R9/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004310&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority), I'm seriously considering getting one to be my daily driver. This is a well-rounded phone with much to offer; it's fun and a conversation starter. It's probably the best folding phone for most people.

 Eventually, I might get sick of constantly having to fold it open, and I still have longevity concerns with the screen on the inside. It's almost always shut until I need it, meaning everything stays safe. I noticed I was distracted by my phone less throughout the day, and my screen time went down, which I'm perfectly okay with. That's probably not Samsung's intention, but I'd see notifications on the cover screen, swipe them away, and be done. Only when it was pressing would I open the phone, which led to fewer moments when I'd hop on my device and get distracted by social media.

 Don't get me wrong, the Z Flip 6 isn't perfect. There are plenty of areas for improvement and Motorola's RAZR series has some notable software advantages. The Z Flip 6's cameras could still be better, and the price increase isn't ideal. It was already expensive for a phone that's not as good as the flagship Galaxy S series, and now it's $100 more. That puts it in an odd spot.

 Throwing the compact Z Flip 6 in my pocket has been a joy for the last few weeks, but there aren't many advantages over getting a regular phone. It's a cool device and would be suitable for a first-time folding phone buyer. However, those looking for a huge screen that'll let you get more done may want to consider the new [Galaxy Z Fold 6 instead](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instagrams-best-grids-built-by-the-top-tools-compiled-here/).
