 Besides, you should keep your audio drivers up-to-date in order to secure the stability of your audio devices. An outdated or corrupt driver can lead to the malfunctions of Nahimic, so if you want to get the most out of it, updating your audio driver seems necessary.

## How can I update the Nahimic audio drivers?

 There are mainly three ways you can update your audio drivers for Nahimic.

**[Option 1 – Download & install the drivers from manufacturers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.  
  
**[Option 2 – Update the driver via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the most common method to update your driver, but sometimes Windows may fail to provide you with the latest (and even necessary) device drivers.

**[Option 3 – Update the driver automatically (recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option.

### Option 1 – Download & install the drivers from manufacturers

 Usually you can get the sound card drivers from the manufacturer of your motherboard. To do this, simply visit its official website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download the drivers manually. If you’re using the Realtek HD Audio Driver, you can also download the driver from **[Realtek](https://www.realtek.com/en/downloads)**  .

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver. On completion, restart your PC for the changes to be fully implemented.
