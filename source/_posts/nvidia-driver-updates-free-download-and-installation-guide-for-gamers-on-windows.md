### Option 1 – Download and install your Nvidia 3D Vision driver manually

 Nvidia keeps updating drivers. To get the latest driver for your Nvidia 3D Vision, you need to go to the **[Nvidia website](https://www.geforce.com/drivers)**  , search the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download it manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
