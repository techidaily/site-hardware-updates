## Discover Logitech's Latest Affordable Mouse with 7 Playful Design Options

Logitech sells a lot of keyboards and mice, and even the company’s budget options are usually great devices. Logitech has now released a new affordable wireless mouse with multiple style options: the M340.

 Logitech just released the [M340 wireless mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/m340-wireless-mouse-collection.910-007281.html), with a few different fun design options and an affordable $20 price tag. Unfortunately, the mouse doesn’t support a regular Bluetooth connection, the Logi Bolt adapter, or Logitech’s older Unifying Receiver. The only connection method is the included 2.4 GHz USB wireless receiver, which can be stored inside the mouse when the mouse isn’t used and has a 10-meter range. If you lose that, you can’t use the mouse anymore. The receiver is also USB Type-A, so if you have a laptop or tablet that only has Type-C, you’ll need an adapter.

 The M340 is available in several different styles, with different styles of recycled plastic: Speckles, Blue Floral, Floral Leaves, Sheer Dream, Tropical Sunrise, Blue Galaxy, and Floral Bouquet. Logitech says the entire mouse uses at least 42% recycled plastic, excluding the packaging and USB receiver. Again, the mouse becomes e-waste if you lose the adapter, but at least the initial production is less damaging to the environment.

 The design is similar to Logitech’s earlier Pebble Mouse series, with slim packaging and support for both left-handed and right-handed use. The flat design means it easily fits into a bag or pocket, but it might be less comfortable to use over long periods than the more ergonomic [MX Anywhere](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-anywhere-3s.910-006925.html) or [Logi Lift](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/lift-vertical-ergonomic-mouse.html).

 Like most of Logitech’s other wireless mice, the M340 uses a single AA battery for power, and there’s even one included in the box. The mouse is estimated to last “up to 18 months” until you need to change the battery. That estimate depends on how often you use the mouse and the type of AA battery (e.g. rechargeable AA batteries usually have less capacity).

 You can [buy the Logitech M340](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/m340-wireless-mouse-collection.910-007282.html) from the company’s online store. As of the time of writing, Speckles and some of the other designs are out of stock, but others like Blue Galaxy are available. The mice should also appear at other retailers soon.
