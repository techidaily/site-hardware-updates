**\*There are a few more monitor models not listed here,** but these are typically minor alterations (i.e., screen size) or slightly down- or upgraded versions of the "main" 32-inch offering.

 **\*\*These monitors largely use self-branded HDR10 and HDR10+ ratings at brightness levels that would be considered insufficient for proper DisplayHDR** (500 or higher). However, OLEDs and VA panels do have superb per-pixel dimming, so support for the HDR signal can still be decent here.

 **\*\*\*The most notable omission, the 27-inch G60SD Odyssey OLED, is a 1440p 360 Hz panel** and the fastest overall of the new batch.

 This year, Samsung's Odyssey OLED monitors are pushing high refresh rate as a primary feature, with the 4K models boasting up to 240 Hz refresh rate and the 1440p models going up to 360 Hz refresh rate. Alongside the integration of the NQ8 Gen3 AI processor used in Samsung's 8K TVs, the 4K OLED G8 can upscale content to 4K when using Samsung Gaming Hub or native TV apps.

 All OLED models have[AMD FreeSync Premium Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com) support, Samsung OLED Safeguard+, and OLED Flare Free Technology. The latter two features help protect the OLED from screen burn-in and prevent glare from disrupting image quality, respectively.

 Samsung's Smart Monitor upgrades also include the NQM AI processor for the 4K Smart Monitor M8, as well as unique Active Voice Amplifier Pro and 360[Audio](https://tools.techidaily.com) Mode features. The 360 Audio Mode only works when paired with Samsung's Galaxy Buds, and another Smart Monitor feature, Workout Tracker, also requires pairing to a Galaxy Watch.
