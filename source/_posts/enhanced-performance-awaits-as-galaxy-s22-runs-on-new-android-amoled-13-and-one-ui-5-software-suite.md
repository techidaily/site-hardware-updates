## Enhanced Performance Awaits as Galaxy S22 Runs on New Android Amoled 13 and One UI 5 Software Suite

[Google released Android 13](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-country-on-app-store-for-apple-iphone-se-2022-with-7-methods-by-drfone-ios/) earlier this year in August, but the update still hasn't reached many phones and tablets. Samsung is now starting to bring Android 13 to its own phones, starting with the [Galaxy S22 series](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/total-gaze-coverage-camera-analysis-for-2024/).

 Samsung is now rolling out its version of Android 13, known as One UI 5.0, to the Galaxy S22 series. The initial reports were mostly limited to Europe, but it has started rolling out in the United States as well. Verizon has started pushing the update to phones, and other carriers (and the unlocked versions) will likely follow soon.

 One UI 5 includes everything in Google's regular Android 13 update, such as an improved taskbar for tablets, new media control widgets, upgraded security, and new functionality for app developers. Samsung has added a slew of features on top, including more lock screen customization features ([possibly inspired by iOS 16](https://network-issues.techidaily.com/enhancing-gameplay-fixing-civ-5-crashes/)), more themes for the cover screen on the Galaxy Z Flip series, Samsung Wallet for mobile payments and cards (which [started rolling out in June](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/tutorial-to-change-realme-imei-without-root-a-comprehensive-guide-by-drfone-android/)), and other changes.

 Like most system updates for Android devices, One UI 5 is a staged rollout, so not everyone will have access to it right now. There's no word on when the stable updates for other models will appear, like the Galaxy Z series, older S flagships, and Galaxy Tabs. If previous major releases are any indication, the update should appear on more devices over the coming weeks and months.
