## Weekend Deal: Slash Prices by Half on Arlo Secure Home Package

Best Buy has an Arlo Essential Camera bundle bundle for half off this weekend, and this is a deal you don't want to miss.

 Setting up a security system can be a big investment—not only in terms of money but also in terms of time researching brands and ensuring they're reputable. Arlo is a great brand, and our new and improved pick for the [best wireless security camera](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-enhance-your-game-experience-with-these-5-screen-capture-techniques-for-minecraft-mac/), the [Arlo Essential Camera](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Farlo-essential-4-camera-outdoor-wireless-2k-security-camera-2nd-generation-with-yard-sign-white%2F6553152.p%3FskuId%3D6553152), is half off at Best Buy this weekend.

 Specifically, a four-pack of the cameras are available for $169.99, $170 off the normal asking price. Four cameras are enough to cover all the important areas of a smaller home, so it's a great start to building your own security system, as well as upgrading your outdoor security.

 We loved the original [Arlo Essential Spotlight Cameras](https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Essential-Spotlight-Wire-Free-VMC2330B/dp/B08B3B3LQ3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003648&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Falro-security-bundle%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) because they offered clear 1080p recording, a 130-degree field of view, and plenty more at a good price. This new model updates the video feed to 2K, making videos even more clear regardless of the weather or the time of day. Also, since the cameras are wireless, you don't need to deal with the hassle of running cables outside (though you might want to consider a [solar panel](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-game-streaming-tool-analysis-choose-obs-or-shadowplay/) to charge the units so you don't need to take them down again).

 The one important thing to note, however, is that to get access to everything you'll need an [Arlo Secure](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/arlosecure.html) subscription. No one likes subscriptions, but almost all security camera companies use them now, so it's a concession you may have to make. With the normal Secure subscription, you'll get 4K recordings that are stored on the cloud for 30 days, object detection, and plenty more for $13 a month for all cameras. Not a bad deal, all things considered.
