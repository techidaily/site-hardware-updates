## Game On Anywhere with ASUS's Sleek, Ultra-Portable 14 Fighter – The Perfect Blend of Size and Strength!

There are a lot of gaming laptops out there, but the ASUS TUF Gaming series has stood out for its decent design and affordability. ASUS has now revealed two new models built with new AMD processors, including a compact 14-inch laptop.

 ASUS has announced the new TUF Gaming A14, a brand new ultraportable 14-inch gaming laptop “with excellent performance and upgradeability,” and the TUF Gaming A16, an updated version of the existing 16-inch gaming laptop. The laptops share a similar design, though the 16-inch model is bulkier to allow more powerful components.

 Both laptops will use “up to” an AMD Ryzen 9 AI HX 370 processor, which has 12 cores, 24 threads, and a built-in NPU capable of 50 TOPS for AI workloads. That's one of the [Zen 5 processors that AMD just announced](https://techidaily.com/the-way-to-recover-deleted-pictures-on-infinix-smart-8-without-backup-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/). The laptops will also have dedicated NVIDIA GeForce RTX graphics cards for gaming and—you guessed it—more demanding AI workloads.

 The built-in NPU will improve on-device AI and machine learning tasks, such as eye-gaze correction on the webcam during video calls and some Microsoft Copilot tools. There’s no mention of the [Copilot+ PC certification](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-my-spouse-from-spying-on-my-motorola-moto-g24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) anywhere, so it’s unclear if all Windows AI features (like [Recall](https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/leveraging-chatgpt-for-effective-meditation-routines-a-step-by-step-guide/)) will be available.

 The TUF Gaming A14, pictured above, weighs only 3.2 pounds (1.46 kg) and measures 0.67 inches (1.69 cm) in depth, which is about the as the 14-inch MacBook Pro. It supports up to an RTX 4060 graphics card with a 100W maximum TDP, which ASUS claims is “far higher than many of its competitors.” There are two M.2 2280 SSD slots for storage that can be upgraded, but it doesn’t seem like the RAM can be upgraded down the line. The USB Type-C port can be used to charge the laptop, which you don’t see often on gaming laptops.

 The TUF Gaming A16, pictured below, is the larger and more powerful model, with up to an RTX 4070 graphics card. ASUS has upgraded the cooling system from the previous A16, with new “full-width heatsink and exhaust vents” and two second-generation Arc Flow fans. The surface temperature is a whole 7° C lower than the previous model, based on ASUS’s own tests.

 The TUF Gaming A14 and TUF Gaming A16 will be available to purchase later in 2024\. ASUS has not yet confirmed pricing in the US for either laptop.
