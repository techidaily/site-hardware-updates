## Kubuntu Unveils Its Latest Range of Linux Notebooks - Available in 14 and 16-Inch Sizes for Optimal Focus Performance

Kubuntu Focus has been selling desktop and laptop computers with Kubuntu Linux pre-installed for a while now. The company has just released an updated version of its 14-inch laptop, as well as a brand new 16-inch model.

 Kubuntu Focus has launched the second generation of its [popular 14-inch laptop](https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-embrace-xps-film-editor-installation-guide/), the Kubuntu Focus lr14 Gen 2\. This new model boasts a significant upgrade in processing power with an Intel Core i5-13500H Raptor Lake processor and support for up to 96GB of DDR5-5200 memory. The base configuration now includes 16GB of RAM and 500GB of PCIe 4.0 NVMe storage, a noticeable improvement over the previous model's 8GB and 256GB. Additionally, the webcam has been upgraded, enhancing the overall user experience.

 It's notable that Kubuntu Focus opted for a 13th gen Intel chip rather than a 14th gen one. The 14th gen Intel chip lineup is already half past its lifespan, with Intel unveiling the Lunar Lake architecture for what's most certainly going to be the 15th gen range (or the "Series 2" Core and Core Ultra chips) later this year. Still, this is still pretty good stuff, as these chips are still pretty good today (and are probably a bit more affordable to get considering they're an older model). The i5-13500H is also part of the H-series range of chips, which is more powerful and more performant, so hopefully, we'll get some pretty sick performance out of this model. We'll have to wait and see.

 Kubuntu Focus has also expanded its offerings with the introduction of a 16-inch model. This larger laptop features a higher-resolution display, a larger battery, and a number pad, catering to users seeking a more expansive workspace and extended battery life.

 While retaining the sleek design and lightweight build of its predecessor, the Kubuntu Focus lr14 Gen 2 comes with a higher starting price of $1080\. Meanwhile, the more expensive 16-inch Ir16 starts at $1145\. Both are identical other than the screen, dimensions, and battery life, so it really comes down to what matters most to you. The laptops are now available for purchase on the [Kubuntu Focus website](https://kfocus.org/order/).
