### Option 1: Download and install the RTX 3090 driver automatically (Recommended)

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Option 2: Download and install the RTX 3090 driver manually

 If you have the time and computer skills, you can also download and install the RTX 3090 driver manually.

 If your PC is having persistent display issues, we recommend you use a [third-party driver updater](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . A professional tool not only updates drivers on your PC, it also _fixes_  those that are either broken or missing altogether.

1. First go to the[**NVIDIA driver download page**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
2. Set the**Product Type** ,**Product Series** and**Product** accordingly. Make sure you choose the correct**Operating System** . Then click**SEARCH.**  
 For**Download Type** , choose**Game Ready Driver (GRD)** for gaming purposes; or choose**Studio Driver (SD)** for graphic design.
