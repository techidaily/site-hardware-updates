## Affordable Prices for Trustworthy Anker Noise-Cancelling In-Ear Headphones - Shop Now!

If you need a pair of wireless earbuds that don't cost much but will last you, take note of the [Soundcore by Anker Life A1](https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Wireless-Customized-Waterproof-Bluetooth/dp/B08KDZ2NZX/?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) pair. I've had them for a couple of years, and while they don't cover every audio need, they serve me wellâ€”and they're on deep discount right now during Prime Day.

 First, be aware these earbuds won't win any awards for audio quality. Listening to music on them is just OK; I prefer my wired over-the-ear [headphones](https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/perfezionamento-dei-numeri-italiani-per-la-comunicazione-da-1-1000/) for that. When I'm doing chores, exercising, cooking, or working on a repair project, though, those wires get in the way and the headphone cups can feel too cumbersome to carry on my head. So I pop out the Life A1's when I need to stay mobile and avoid entanglements, especially if all I'm listening to is a podcast or YouTube video. I'm not an audiophile, so music often sounds good enough for me as background while I'm busy.

#####  Soundcore Life A1

These affordable wireless earbuds have a battery life and noise cancellation abilities that will keep you listening all day long.

[$50 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Wireless-Customized-Waterproof-Bluetooth/dp/B08KDZ2NZX/?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) [See at Soundcore](https://howl.me/cmGrceTMcle) [See at Newegg](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3D2QzUaswX1as%26mid%3D44583%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fsoundcore-life-a1-wireless%252Fp%252F0TH-033Y-000H5%26u1%3Dhtgeditorialpost71624) 

 Even then, music sounds better on these compared to other cheap wireless earbuds I've used in the past. The [active noise cancellation](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-sharing-twitch-on-your-fb-page-for-2024/) (ANC) works well enough I can listen clearly in a loud environment, like while I vacuum. There are some nice little quality-of-life features, too, like the case's ability to charge wirelessly. The case itself holds enough juice to recharge the earbuds three times and can give your earbuds about 2 hours of life in 10 minutes of charging. Fully charged, the Anker says the earbuds last 10 hours. In my experience, it's more like 8 hours, but that's probably due in part to my pair being a couple of years old now.

 Normally, the Soundcore Life A1 earbuds will run you $50\. If you [look at the Amazon price history](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-instagram-insights-pro-tips-for-downloading-igtv-videos-on-computers/), you'll see they regularly go on sale for $35, so being available at $33 right now (a 35 percent discount) is a slightly better deal than normal. The only time in recent history they've been cheaper was when they hit $30 this past December, so you're likely going to have to wait a while to get a better deal.

 If you need better audio quality, it's worth checking out the [Soundcore Liberty 4 NC](https://www.amazon.com/soundcore-Cancelling-Reduction-Environment-Bluetooth-dp-B0BZV4QFP8/dp/B0BZV4QFP8?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) earbuds, which have better drivers and more advanced ANC. They're also on sale right now for $70, which is 30 percent off the regular price, and we think they're some of [the best wireless earbuds out there](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/locked-out-of-apple-iphone-xs-max-5-ways-to-get-into-a-locked-apple-iphone-xs-max-by-drfone-ios/). For my needs, though, the Life A1s get the job done at a super affordable price.
