## Experience Enhanced Productivity with Sabrent's $350 Hybrid Display and Thunderbolt Dock - Featuring 65W USB-C, Ethernet Ports, and More

Sabrent has launched[the DS-T4WA](https://sabrent.com/products/thunderbolt-4-docking-station-with-monitor-desk-mount) Thunderbolt 4 docking station with monitor desk mount functionality. The storage-related accessories specialist must see some mileage in this particular niche, and the DS-T4WA combines a feature-packed hub at the base with a gas-lift mount supporting monitors up to 32 inches and 10kg.

 With the growing popularity of hybrid working practices, the convenience of high-performance docking solutions shines. When returning to base, a road warrior will typically also want to connect up to a large screen, and this must be where Sabrent thought its DS-T4WA would win extra approval.

 Pondering over the monitor mount features first, we shall repeat that this adjustable gas-lift arm can hold monitors up to 32 inches and up to 10kg in weight. A 32-inch monitor isn’t that big in 2024, though, and it might be pretty small to cater to the fanfare 8K display dock capability.

 The docking features of the Sabrent DS-T4WA are pretty extensive. From the product name and description, users only need to plug in a single Thunderbolt 4 cable to their device to enjoy the many ports on offer. Once connected, the following ports become available:
