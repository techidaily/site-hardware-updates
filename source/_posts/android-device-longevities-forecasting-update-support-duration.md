### Key Takeaways

* There are two types of Android updates: security updates and major OS upgrades. Security updates are more frequent and important for device security, while major OS upgrades typically happen annually.
* Samsung and Google offer the most reliable update support. Samsung provides four Android upgrades and five years of security updates, while Google promises up to seven years of OS updates and security updates for their Pixel devices.

 Updates are a big deal in the Android world. While Apple controls the iPhone update process, Google does not have that power over all Android devices. How are you supposed to know how long your [Android phone](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/hot-takes-highlight-twitters-trending-topics-for-2024/) will get updates? We'll help you.

##  It's All About the Manufacturer

 When it comes to Android devices and updates, you can't look at all of Android as a whole. The question is not "when will my Android phone be supported?" It's "when will my \[manufacturer\] phone be supported?"

 There used to be many manufacturers pumping out Android devices, but it's been mostly narrowed down to Samsung, Google, and a few smaller playersâ€”at least in the U.S. We'll focus on those companies.

##  Android OS Upgrade vs. Security Update

 Before we dive in, there's one distinction that needs to be made. There are two types of Android updates: security updates and OS updates. [Security updates](https://common-error.techidaily.com/simple-solutions-troubleshooting-and-enhancing-your-file-explorer-on-windows-11/) are smaller and arrive more frequently. They don't typically include big changes, but they're very important.

 Android upgrades or "major OS updates" are yearly. This is when Android 12 upgrades to Android 13, One UI 3 to One UI 4, etc. Typically, devices will get one more year of security updates after they receive their last OS upgrade.

 Update timelines begin at the time of release. If a device was launched in October 2021 and receives five years of security updates, the last update will be in October 2026, regardless of when you purchased it.

 Samsung releases [a lot of Android devices](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-connecting-consciously-with-content-craftsmen-of-your-realm-for-2024/), and they don't all receive the same amount of updates. Thankfully, the company maintains a detailed "[Security Updates Scope](https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb)" website with information for specific devices.

[Starting with the Galaxy S24 series](https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-android-video-editors-for-chromebook-top-recommendations/), Samsung upped the ante even more with seven years of updates. That's seven years of security updates and OS upgrades. The S24 series will be updated all the way to Android 21.

 Updates are released on a monthly, quarterly, and biannual schedule. Newer Samsung devices prior to the S24 series receive updates more frequently. Devices launched in 2019 or later receive four years of security updates, while newer devices receive up to five years.

 In addition to those security updates, Samsung offers four Android upgrades for a majority of its devices. The list of those devices can be [found on Samsung's website](https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/press-releases/samsung-sets-the-new-standard-with-four-generations-of-os-upgrades-to-ensure-the-most-up-to-date-and-more-secure-galaxy-experience/), and it includes newer models from those series' as well.

 The short answer for the majority of Samsung devices is you'll get four Android upgrades and five years of security updates.

 Google doesn't have nearly as many devices to worry about as Samsung, but they're still not treated equally. Support timelines for [Pixel devices](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-path-to-wealthy-creatorland-for-ajey-nagar/) can be [found here on Google's website](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-pixel-pro-phones).

 Starting with the [Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro](https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-copying-safely-on-tiktok-a-2023-guide-to-rights-checks/), Google is promising seven years of OS updates and security updates. That means the phones will be supported all the way to October 2030.

 Slightly older devices (Pixel 7 series, Pixel 6 series, Pixel 6A, and Pixel Fold) receive three years of Android upgrades and five years of security updates. The Pixel 5a through the Pixel 3a receive three years of Android upgrades and security updates. The Pixel 3 and older Pixels are no longer supported.

##  Samsung and Google Are the Most Reliable

 At the time of writing in October 2023, Samsung and Google are head and shoulders above the rest of the Android world when it comes to updates. Google is easily the top dog if you opt for the company's latest and greatest devices.

 Those are the devices you should consider if you want long-term support. [You don't want to use a phone without up-to-date software](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-profit-from-youtube-monetize-youtube-shorts-and-boost-your-income/).
