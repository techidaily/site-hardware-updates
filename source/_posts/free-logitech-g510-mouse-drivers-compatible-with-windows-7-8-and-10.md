 The Epson WF 2630 driver runs on your operating system, and enables it to communicate with your printer.

 If the driver hasnâ€™t been properly installed on your computer, your printer wonâ€™t fully function. So, when something goes wrong with your Epson WF-2630 printer, updating its driver should always be your go-to option.

There are 2 ways you can do it:

* **[Option 1 â€“ Automatically update the Epson WF2630 driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Option 2 â€“ Download and install the driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### **Option 1 â€“ Automatically update** the Epson WF 2630 **driver** with Driver Easy

 This is the quickest and easiest option. Itâ€™s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks â€“ easy even if youâ€™re a computer newbie.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
