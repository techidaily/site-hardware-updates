## Discover the Stealthy: A Comprehensive Guide to Locating Concealed Android Applications

There are many reasons why someone might want to hide an app---and Android has [plenty of ways to do it.](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-gps-location-on-samsung-galaxy-s24plus-easily-and-safely-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) What if you want to do the opposite, though? Is it possible to find apps that have been hidden?

 Many [home screen launchers](https://www.reviewgeek.com/62940/the-7-best-android-launchers/) and some specialized apps have the ability to hide stuff. This is the method most people will use, but all launchers work differently. Rather than focus on specific methods for hiding apps, we'll show you how to find apps on any Android device.

 The information in this guide should be used responsibly. There are legitimate reasons why someone might hide apps. Unless you have a very good reason not to, you should respect their privacy.

 First, swipe down from the top of the screen once or twice---depending on the manufacturer of your phone---and tap the gear icon to open the Settings.

 Next, go to "Apps."

![Go to "Apps."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-09_16-40-58.png) 

 On some devices, you'll need to tap "See All Apps." Others will go straight to the full app list.

 If your phone has the option, make sure you are looking at "All Apps."

 Now you can see the entire list of apps installed on the device. Even apps that have been hidden by the home screen launcher will appear here. The only way to hide an app from this list would be with some pretty serious hackery.

 That's all there is to it! This will likely be a pretty long list of apps, so it does require a certain level of attention to detail. The hidden apps won't be labeled. But it will work regardless of the app they're using to hide stuff. Just make sure you're not needlessly [violating someone's privacy](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instagrams-essential-quick-tutorial-for-chat/) by doing this.
