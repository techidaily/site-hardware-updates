## Historic Discount Alert! Grab the Logitech G Pro for Just $54 â€“ Best Offer Yet

Gaming peripherals have reached astounding prices for the latest and greatest pieces of tech, but you can still pick up a bargain on some of the older models without losing out on the functionality stakes. The Logitech G Pro was first replaced by the G Pro Superlight and then the G Pro Superlight 2, and although more recent iterations reduced the weight of the mouse, not everything was an upgrade. The Logitech G Pro still has a sensor with a high accuracy 25K DPI and is even truly ambidextrous which unfortunately was a feature that was dropped in the newer models.

 What makes today's deal special is that this superb gaming mouse is on sale at Amazon for its lowest-ever price. You can grab yourself a[Logitech G Pro wireless gaming mouse for just $54](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45723&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07GCKQD77%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomshardware-us-1267352374131438894-20) and look forward to some accurate and smooth gaming mouse action. It might not be the best choice for an MMO, but for most other types of games - especially FPS - it's a superb performer.

 The Logitech G Pro uses a lightweight design and only weighs 80 grams on the scale, so although not the lightest mouse, it won't be that noticeable. You can use the mouse with the cable when charging, but off the cable, the G Pro uses a solid 2.4 GHz wireless connection with a super-fast 1-millisecond report rate that eliminates any noticeable latency.
