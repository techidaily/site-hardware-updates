### Option 1: Install the latest GPU driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, you can update your drivers automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve installed the latest graphics driver, restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

### Option 2: Install the latest GPU driver manually

 You can also install the graphics driver manually, but it’ll take some time and some computer knowledge.

To install manually, you can use these steps:

1. Go to the[driver download page](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of NVIDIA and search for your model.
