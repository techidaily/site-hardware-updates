### Option 1: Install the graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Option 2: Install the graphics driver manually

 It takes time and computer skills to install drivers manually and correctly. If you’re a tech-savvy user, you can try the following steps to install the latest UHD graphics driver on your own.

 If your PC is having persistent display issues, we recommend you use a[third-party driver updater](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . A professional tool not only updates the driver on your PC, it also_fixes_ those that are either broken or missing altogether.

1. Go to[Intel Download Center](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html) . Select**Graphics** .
