## Galaxy Z Fold 5 & Z Flip N5 Unveiled: Shop Now for Latest Foldable Phones

It wasn't too long ago that Samsung officially unveiled its latest range of devices. In addition to two foldable phones, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the Z Flip 5, we also got a range of new tablets belonging to the Galaxy Tab S9 range, as well as two watches belonging to the Galaxy Watch 6 range. If you wanted to buy one, you had the chance to pre-order them as soon as they got announced. Now, they are officially available for purchase.

 Samsung's [Galaxy Z Fold 5](https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/oculus-quest-2-review-easy-excellent-vr-at-an-amazing-price/) and [Z Flip 5](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unveiling-prime-5-chrome-tools-for-facebook-vids/) come with a lot of changes. Notably, improved hinge designs are present on both phones, and in the case of the Z Flip 5, we're also getting a notably improved cover screen that is way bigger and more usable than before. Both phones come with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processors as well as decent amounts of RAM and storage, making for sensible, yet notable improvements to Samsung's already-great foldable range. [The tablets](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-revisiting-social-media-written-history-on-your-laptopsphones/) are also pretty great, coming with improved hardware and a set of features that makes them probably the best Android tablets out there. And [the watches](https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-step-by-step-unlocking-the-joys-of-ifunnys-meme-app/) are awesome â€” longtime Galaxy Watch fans will be glad to hear about the return of the physical rotating bezel with the [Galaxy Watch 6 Classic](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/fix-guide-resolving-the-last-epoch-release-issues-on-pc-2024-edition/).

 If you want to buy one now, the pre-order period is officially over, which means you'll find all of these in store shelves from today onwards. However, just because pre-orders are over doesn't mean that you can't still get some sweet deals on Samsung's new hardware. On Samsung's online store, with an eligible trade-in, you can still get up to $600 off a new Galaxy Z Flip 5, $1,000 off a new Galaxy Z Fold 5, or $250 off a new Galaxy Watch 6 or Watch 6 Classic. And if you're getting one of the tablets, you can get a free Book Cover Keyboard Slim with the purchase of a Tab S9 or a Tab S9+.

 You can buy the [Galaxy Z series](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3D2QzUaswX1as%26mid%3D47773%26u1%3DUUhtgUeUpU904724%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.samsung.com%252Fus%252Fmobile%252Fphones%252Fgalaxy-z%252F), [Galaxy Watch 6](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3D2QzUaswX1as%26mid%3D47773%26u1%3DUUhtgUeUpU904724%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.samsung.com%252Fus%252Fwatches%252F), and [Galaxy Tab S9](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3D2QzUaswX1as%26mid%3D47773%26u1%3DUUhtgUeUpU904724%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.samsung.com%252Fus%252Ftablets%252Fgalaxy-tab-s9%252F) from Samsung's online store now, and they are also showing up at other retail stores and carriers.
