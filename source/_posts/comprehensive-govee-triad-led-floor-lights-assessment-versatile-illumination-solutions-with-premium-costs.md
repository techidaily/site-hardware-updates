### Key Takeaways

* The Govee Triad Flood Light offers fun color combos to illuminate your home using three light heads.

But a lot of planning and money may be needed to truly achieve the visual effect! The Triad Flood Lights are one of the newest additions to Govee's lineup, providing three adjustable heads in one unit with smart home connectivity. I loved playing with the colors; customizing the look of the colors outside my home is a great way to show some personality.

##  Things to Know About Setting Up the Govee Triad Flood Light

 If you’ve used outdoor lights before, then you know there are a few things to consider before installing a floodlight: wiring, power source, and location. Govee Triad Flood Light is a single unit with adjustable heads that can rotate up to 90 degrees, so you can extend the reach of the floodlight.

 The hardware installation itself was a breeze with stakes to push the floodlight into the ground securely. The lighting unit is sturdy and the casing is heavy-duty aluminum, designed to withstand practically any kind of weather. You can adjust the light heads using the included hex wrench.

 However, the smart home set up was a little more cumbersome. The Govee Home app is compatible with Alexa, Siri, and Google Home, but some mobile devices may require that you also install the Matter app to sync with your setup. You’ll also need to make sure that your Wi-Fi router isn’t located too far away from your floodlight, or it might not connect. It took some trial and error, but I was able to set up my light with the Govee Home app to use with Google Home voice controls, and I didn’t have to install Matter.

 Quick tip: Make sure to have the model number handy (H7063), because identifying the right product within the app was the most confusing part of the smart home setup.

##  Govee Triad Flood Light’s Biggest Limitation: The Power Cord

 The power cord for the Govee Triad Flood Light is less than 6 feet long and comes in two parts, limiting you in terms of how far you can keep the light from the house without needing an extension cord. It’s also very helpful if you already have a waterproof power outlet that is accessible from outside your home, otherwise you need to figure out how you’ll be plugging in your flood light safely.

![Photo of the power cord included with the Govee Triad Flood Light](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/53791411283_2ffd74f31c_o.jpg) 

Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 The limitations of the power cord will ultimately impact where you can install your unit. Keep in mind that wherever you place the Govee Triad Flood Light, you will have a cord lying across the lawn or pathway. You’ll need to make sure the placement is somewhere that won’t become a tripping hazard or otherwise unsafe, or where the cord might accidentally get unplugged or detached. Also, check your local building codes to ensure you’re following all the safety rules for lighting around your home.

##  Govee is Known for Quality Lighting

 The Govee website says the range of their floodlight can illuminate a horizontal span of up to 25 feet, but that range depends on how far you can actually install the unit from your home, given the short length of the power cord. The brightness of the floodlight is very impressive at 4500LM. It’s definitely way too intense for indoor use! The lighting looked gorgeous and high quality outside my home. I set it up to test in the backyard, and it easily flooded the outdoor space with color and light.

Close 

 One special feature that is unique to triad-style floodlights is the rainbow-like lighting effect that occurs when the light is obstructed by an object, causing a shadow. I experienced this when I set up my Govee Triad Flood Light next to the deck in the backyard; the three different colors created three different shadows, which looked very pretty! There’s a lot of potential to play with this rainbow effect using plants and other outdoor decor near the floodlight.

##  The Govee Home App is Easy and Fun to Use

 Once you have your Govee Triad Flood Light installed and set up with your smart device, you can start to have some fun! There are three adjustable heads on the Triad Flood Light, which means you can create a color palette using three different colors to truly get the look and feel that you want for your home. You can select colors yourself, or you can pick from a huge library of color presets within the Govee Home App.

##  Govee Is Its Own Competition

 Govee has become one of the bigger players in the lighting industry, thanks to years of quality products. They create a huge assortment of indoor and outdoor RGB lighting options, such as the [Govee RGBIF Floor Lamp Pro](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-discover-the-top-12-tycoon-games-for-captivating-players/), so if the Triad Flood Light doesn’t sound like it would work for your home, you can still check out their website and see what else you might like.

 Depending on the shape of your home or the design of your landscaping, you might want to consider buying a multi-pack of [Govee RGBICWW LED Smart Flood Lights](https://us.govee.com/products/govee-rgbicww-led-smart-flood-lights?Quantity=6+Pack) to strategically add color to the right places. Govee has outdoor lighting products for almost every budget, but you can also take your chances with unknown brands on Amazon who are selling similar items for a fraction of the price.

##  Should You Buy the Govee Triad Flood Light?

[Govee Triad Flood Lights](https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Outdoor-Multicolor-Control-Aluminum/dp/B0CV3TW1KM/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004487&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgovee-triad-flood-lights-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) are a great option if you’re looking for a single unit that can potentially cover your home's entire extior with colored light. The Govee Home app provides endless ways to customize with high-quality, bright-colored light. However, at this price point, people who are on a budget might be happier with something a little more affordable.

 Keep in mind that there may be additional charges associated with outdoor lighting, including the installation of a waterproof outlet and increased electric bills. If you have a big house with lots of landscaping decor, you may be happier with multiple light boxes, rather than a single triad unit. It all depends on your priorities and home setup. But the Govee brand definitely does not disappoint when it comes to quality.
