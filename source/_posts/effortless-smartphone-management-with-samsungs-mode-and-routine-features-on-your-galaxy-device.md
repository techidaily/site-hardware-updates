##  What Are Modes and Routines on Samsung Phones?

 You can think of Samsung's Modes as an extension of [Android's Digital Wellbeing feature](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-increase-youtube-traffic-by-a-million-safely-done-for-2024/). You might know that [Focus mode on Android](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-premier-podplay-writing-treasures/) allows you to block distracting apps. Well, modes on Samsung phones go a step beyond this and can also change your device's settings, customize your wallpaper, and get activated automatically based on conditions other than a set schedule. You can set modes for various activities like sleeping, driving, exercising, and more.

 For example, I've set the Sleep mode on my phone to run from 11:00 PM to 07:00 AM every weekday and [enable Do Not Disturb](https://windows11.techidaily.com/emergency-printer-deletion-in-windows-os-a-step-by-step-approach/), Power Saving, and Grayscale when it's active. That way, I can avoid distractions when I'm trying to sleep, save battery life while my phone is not in use, and get a visual indication that it's bedtime when my screen turns black and white. The next morning, my alarm rings and the mode turns off all the settings it enabled last night.

 Routines, conversely, are far more customizable and can similarly activate themselves when different conditions are met. For example, I've set a routine on my phone to automatically turn on Bluetooth and Dolby Atmos if I open YouTube or Netflix. That way, I don't have to turn them on manually every time and can connect my earbuds right away. I also have a routine that turns on Mobile Data when the Wi-Fi signal strength is low, and to turn off Mobile Data when it's strong again.

 Both modes and routines can be triggered manually or automatically, but you can only have one mode running at a time, whereas multiple routines can run simultaneously.

 The Modes and Routines feature is only available on Samsung Galaxy devices running One UI 5 or later. On devices running earlier One UI versions, you'll still be able to [set routines via Bixby Routines](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-sleepy-sequences-examining-bedtime-story-video-adaptations/).

##  How to Set Up and Use Modes on Samsung

 Samsung offers a list of preset modes like Sleep, Work, Exercise, and more that you can configure as per your needs and start using right away. All of these help minimize distractions from your phone, but each one suggests additional settings to facilitate the activity you're doing.

 To access the feature, open settings by swiping down once from the top of the screen and tapping the gear icon.

![The control panel on a Samsung phone, highlighting the gear icon.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230922_132910_nova-launcher.jpg) 

 Next, tap "Modes and Routines" to open the app.

![The 'Modes and Routines' option in One UI's settings.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230922_163603_settings.jpg) 

 Here, you'll see a list of preset modes. Select one and tap "Start" to begin the guided setup.

![List of preset modes on Samsung.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/list-of-preset-modes-on-samsung.jpeg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 On the first screen, select the condition(s) that should be met for the mode to get activated automatically. Depending on which mode you're configuring, the appropriate condition(s) to activate it will vary. You'll see suggested conditions that you can select during the setup.

 These conditions include opening an app of your choice, connecting your phone to a Bluetooth device, entering or leaving a location, or setting a schedule. Once you've set a condition, tap "Next" at the bottom to continue. If you only want to activate the mode manually, tap "Skip" instead.

 Location-based activation works by detecting your proximity to the set location. Because of this, you'll need to [keep the Location service on your device turned on](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/the-evolution-of-artistic-expression-in-the-age-of-ai-writing-assistants/) at all times for the feature to work. Doing this will reduce your battery life and is hence not recommended.

 On the second screen, toggle on "Do Not Disturb" to mute calls and notifications. To avoid missing the important stuff, you can also set exceptions to Do Not Disturb by tapping "Calls And Messages" and "App Notifications" and following the on-screen instructions.

![Adding Do not disturb to Work mode on Samsung.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/adding-do-not-disturb-to-work-mode-on-samsung.jpeg) 

 On the third screen, choose the settings you want to apply when this mode is active from the list of suggestions. These settings include adjusting the sound mode and volume level, playing music, [enabling Power Saving to save battery life](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-whatsapp-messages-on-samsung-galaxy-xcover-6-pro-tactical-edition-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), opening an app of your choice, and more. Once set, hit "Done" at the bottom.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 The mode is now set, and you can see all its details on the summary page. You can customize it at any time and add more settings to apply or change your lock screen and home screen wallpapers when the mode is active.

 For now, let's continue with the setup and toggle on "Restrict App Usage."

![The 'Restrict App Usage' option in Modes and Routines.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230922_163831_modes-and-routines.jpg)

 Your custom mode is now set!

##  How to Create a Custom Routine on Samsung

 Creating a routine is similar to creating a custom mode, but you get a lot more triggers and commands to choose from. The process is also a little simpler and easier to understand. To begin, open Modes and Routines and go to the "Routines" tab at the bottom.

![Routines tab in Modes and Routines app on Samsung.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/routines-tab-in-modes-and-routines-app-on-samsung.jpeg)

 And you're done! This routine has been added to your saved routines.

##  How to Create a Shortcut to Modes and Routines

 There's an easier way to access the modes and routines you've set. For instance, you can manually activate your saved modes via the Quick Settings panel.

 To set this up, swipe down twice from the top of the screen to open the Quick Settings panel. Next, swipe left until you reach the last page. Here, tap the "+" button.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Tapping the "Modes" button in the Quick Settings panel will pull up a pop-up showing all your saved modes. Tap one to activate it manually.

 Similarly, you can add widgets to your home screen for routines you've created that use manual activation. To do this, long-press your home screen and tap the "Widgets" button.

![Home screen widgets menu on Samsung.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/home-screen-widgets-menu-on-samsung.jpeg) 

 From the list, find and tap "Modes and Routines" to reveal the app's widgets. Drag "Single Routine" and drop it on your home screen. If you've created multiple routines, select the one of your choice.
