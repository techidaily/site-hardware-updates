 Files by Android is pre-installed on some Android devices. If it's not on yours, you can download it from the [Google Play Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU206512/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files).

![Install &quot;Files by Google.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/install.png?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

 The first time you open the app you'll be asked to agree to Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tap "Continue" to proceed if you agree.

![Tap &quot;Continue&quot; to agree to Google's terms and privacy policy.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a.png) 

 Give the app permission to access your files by tapping "Allow" in the permissions popup.

![Tap &quot;Allow&quot; to give Google access to your files.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/b.png) 

 Now with all that out of the way we can get started. First, switch over to the "Clean" tab in the bottom bar.

 Give the app a second or two to load everything. You should see a "Delete Duplicates" card somewhere on this screen. Tap "Select Files" to go into it.

 Again, you may need to give the app a second to load the files. Now you'll see all of the duplicate files listed side-by-side with the original file labeled. You can tap "All Duplicates" to keep the original and remove all the duplicates or go through and manually select the files.

 After you've made your selections tap the "Move Files to Trash" button at the bottom of the screen.

![Tap "Move Files to Trash."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-03-22_11-00-10.jpg) 

 Tap "Move Files to Trash" again to confirm.
