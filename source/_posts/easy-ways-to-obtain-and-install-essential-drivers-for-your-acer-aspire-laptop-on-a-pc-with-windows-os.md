## How to download Toshiba Bluetooth drivers?

There are two ways you can download your Toshiba Bluetooth drivers.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-toshiba-bluetooth-driver/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can go to the[Toshiba support website](https://support.dynabook.com/bluetoothhttp:/support.toshiba.com/bluetooth) , type your model name and find the drivers for your system version, then download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### **Option 2 – Automatically update Toshiba Bluetooth driver**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.
