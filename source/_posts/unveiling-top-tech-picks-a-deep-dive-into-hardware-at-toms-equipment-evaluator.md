 See our[review of the Alienware m18 R2](https://tools.techidaily.com) where we reviewed a slightly less powerful version of this gaming behemoth, but still were impressed with it enough to award it one of our coveted Editor's Choice awards and give it 4 stars in our review. We were fans of its sturdy build quality (although heavy), strong gaming performance, and inclusion of a low-profile Cherry switch mechanical keyboard.
