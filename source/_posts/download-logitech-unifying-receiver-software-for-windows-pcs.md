## Method 1: Download and update the driver manually

 If you prefer to download drivers manually, you can download and update your Logitech wireless keyboard driver manually from Logitech official website:

 1) Go to[Logitech Download page](http://support.logitech.com/en%5Fus/downloads)  .  
  
 2) Type your Logitech wireless keyboard model name in the search box and click the **More**  button for more content. (Let’s take K400 for example.)

There might be several products listed in the screen. Click on your product name then you will be directed to the product page.

## Method 2: Download and update the driver automatically

 To download driver from Logitech website, you need to identify the right driver from the software list. It could be waste of time. It is harder if you don’t know much about computer. So if you would like to download Logitech wireless keyboard drivers more easily, instead of downloading drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.
