## To update your fingerprint driver in Windows

**OR**

[**Option 2 â€“ Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) â€“ Youâ€™ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

### Option 1: Update your fingerprint driver automatically (Recommended)

 To update your fingerprint driver manually, youâ€™ll need to go to the manufacturerâ€™s official website (such as **[Synaptic](https://www.synaptics.com/) [s](https://www.synaptics.com/)**  ), find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.
