## Add an Authentic Retro Touch: Choose the Perfect Numerical Panel for Classic Mechanical Keyboards

Not feeling the tenkeyless life? This mechanical numpad is for you, especially if you own 8BitDo's mechanical keyboard.

 Last year, [8BitDo stepped into the mechanical keyboard ring](https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/latest-sas-software-drivers-free-downloads-and-updates-for-windows-10-8-and-7/) with its retro-inspired keyboard line. For many (myself included), the keyboard was a nice shot of nostalgia at a reasonable price—$109.99 for the keyboard and two humorously gigantic macro buttons is very affordable considering much of the competition.

 Since last year, 8BitDo has been expanding the line with a [Commodore 64 version](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-foremost-suggestions-premium-iphone-tone-makers/) (available now) and an [IBM-inspired keyboard](https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-mechanical-keyboard-m/) (releasing in July). One thing is missing from all of these keyboards, however. Since these are [tenkeyless (TKL)](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-after-switching-from-itel-p55-to-latest-samsung-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/) models, they lack the numerical keypad found on typical, full-sized keyboards.

 The solution? The [Retro 18 Mechanical Numpad](https://www.amazon.com/8BitDo-Retro-Mechanical-Numpad-Gaming-Console/dp/B0D4QGX9QB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003427&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fget-a-chunky-retro-numpad-for-your-chunky-retro-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), 8BitDo's companion accessory to the retro keyboards. This is essentially a numpad you can add on and use when you need it—handy when you're limited on desk space and don't need the numerical pad constantly. You can also use this numpad as a regular old calculator if you need to do some quick math, a cute novelty most external numerical pads can't do. If you need your quick calculations on-screen, though, the Retro 18 also features a button that acts as a shortcut to Window's Calculator app.

 All in all, the Retro 18 is a neat accessory to the Retro Keyboard, and the missing piece you might need to make this keyboard your daily driver.

 Four options are available for pre-order now at $44.99, each a companion to one of the retro keyboards. They'll be released on July 15th!
