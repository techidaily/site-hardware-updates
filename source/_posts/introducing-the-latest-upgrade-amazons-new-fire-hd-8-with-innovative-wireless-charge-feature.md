Amazon recently [launched new Kindles](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/streamline-creation-with-no-cost-high-quality-banner-templates-for-2024/), but many people prefer the company's full-fledged tablets instead. If you're part of that crowd, you'll be glad to know Amazon has just announced renewed versions of its [Fire HD 8 tablet lineup](https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/decoded-troubleshooting-failed-writes-to-0x-pointed-out-memory-slot-0x/), coming with a slew of improvements --- and similar pricing.

 Amazon has officially announced new versions of the Fire HD 8 and the Fire HD 8 Plus. Both devices have a new hexa-core CPU that promises up to 30% better performance, so you can browse the web, watch videos, or play the occasional game.

 They also have Dolby Atmos support for better media viewing, which you can enjoy with Prime Video if you happen to have Amazon Prime.
