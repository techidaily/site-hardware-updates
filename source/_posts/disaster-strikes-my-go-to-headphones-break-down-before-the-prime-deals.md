## Disaster Strikes: My Go-To Headphones Break Down Before the Prime Deals!

Audio-Technica's ATH-M50x headphones are some of the best and most popular wired headphones ever made, and for good reason. I've used a pair almost every single day for about 7 years until they finally failed, and I'm confident my new pair will last at least that long.

##  Great Audio is Worth the Price

 Audio technology doesn't really move in the same leaps and bounds as other tech we use in our day-to-day lives. A pair of wired headphones or speakers today will be as good in 5 years as the day you buy them, assuming you take care of them.

 The ATH-M50X has a pretty balanced sound profile—it isn't particularly bass or treble heavy, which makes it easier to [equalize the sound however you'd](https://windows11.techidaily.com/savor-ultimate-digital-windows-world/) like later on. They're also [closed-back](https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-sharefake-location-on-whatsapp-for-tecno-spark-10-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), which means you will hear less of the world around you, and you don't need to worry about your neighbors jamming to _your_ music.

 Besides the audio quality, the general build quality is excellent. The M50X features many user-replaceable parts (which I've done over the years!) and a fully detachable cable. The detachable cable has been particularly nice, since I frequently carry my headphones between my desktop PC, my laptop, and my digital piano. I wound up buying a [few additional braided cables](https://www.amazon.com/NewFantasia-Replacement-Technica-Headphones-1-2meters/dp/B00N0XP2ES?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) to leave with different devices, so I didn't need to worry about fumbling around with aux ports (or 1/4 jacks) on the back of my PC or my piano.

 I purchased my pair sometime in 2017, and I wore them almost every single day between then and now—and I wasn’t gentle. They went through a wash once, regularly took tumbles off my desk, went on a few camping trips, and were turned into a bed by a cat. They just kept chugging until a final tumble down the stairs did them in. For something designed to be worn on your head and not treated like a soccer ball, that is a truly fantastic run.

 be spending it again.

[The ATH-M50X is currently going for $119 on Prime Day](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50x-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B00HVLUR86?tag=htgprimedaysite-20), and I'll gladly buy them again.
