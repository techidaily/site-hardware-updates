## Still on Your Old iPad? Snag the Cheapest Offer Yet with the Apple Pencil 2!

New products almost always mean older versions go on sale. Take advantage of that now with the Apple Pencil 2 at its lowest price.

 The new iPad Air and iPad Pro models look great (and [we especially love the Pro](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-tutorial-to-bypass-your-oneplus-ace-2v-face-lock-by-drfone-android/)), as does the brand-new [Apple Pencil Pro](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-realme-c33-2023-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). But that doesn't mean you want to upgrade to these new iPads! In fact, iPads have a pretty long shelf-life compared to other tablets, so unless you're a professional or hobbyist who wants some of the features the new models and Apple Pencil Pro have to offer, you may be more than happy to stick with your current iPad.

 If you're one of those people, you can still take advantage of the new iPad model releases by saving on older accessories. Since the [Apple Pencil Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-Pro-Pixel-Perfect-Industry-Leading/dp/B0D3J71RM7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003189&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fapple-pencil-2-discount%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is only compatible with the latest iPad Air and iPad Pro models, you don't want to buy the new stylus if you're not planning on upgrading. On the flip side, the Apple Pencil 2nd Generation is compatible with the iPad mini and the previous generation of iPad Air and iPad Pro.

 If you're ever wondering about compatibility, [Apple's page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108937) will be the easiest way to check to see what Apple Pencil you want—but for most, the [Apple Pencil 2](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003189&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fapple-pencil-2-discount%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is the stylus to get.

 Apple is very much in the 'out with the old, in with the new' camp, which means the 2nd Generation Apple Pencil is now on its way 'out' and on sale for just $79\. This is the lowest price for this fantastic stylus yet, and while we've seen the Apple Pencil at this price before, it was usually only during bigger sales events. This price drop is more likely to stick, and it's never a better time to get one of the [best iPad accessories](https://techidaily.com/guide-on-how-to-erase-apple-iphone-6s-data-completely-drfone-by-drfone-ios-full-data-eraser-ios-full-data-eraser/).

 If you're wondering if the Apple Pencil is worth the investment, even at the discounted price—it is. Not only is the Apple Pencil 2 great for drawing, but it also does a great job at replicating the 'natural' handwriting experience, with top-notch tilt and pressure sensitivity, no lag, and more. It's truly a joy to use, and while alternatives may be cheaper, they can't compete with the Apple Pencil's seamless compatibility.
