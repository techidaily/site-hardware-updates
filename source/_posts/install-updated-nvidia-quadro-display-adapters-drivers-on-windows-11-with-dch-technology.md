![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7e946a16130-300x190.jpg) Sometimes Windows changes the way it speaks to hardware. Each time this happens, your drivers need to be updated so they can translate the new commands properly, and your devices will understand them. To have a better display effect, you should update your display driver.

There are two ways to update your Nvidia display driver.

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your display driver this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/nvidia-display-driver-download-and-install-for-windows/#o2) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1 – Download and install the Nvidia display driver manually

 Nvidia keeps updating drivers. To get the latest display driver, you need to go to the[Nvidia official website](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) , find **the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows** , then download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct display driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
