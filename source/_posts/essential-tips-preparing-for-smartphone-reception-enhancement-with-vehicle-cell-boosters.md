 Everyone hates having no cell service. Being able to boost the cellular signal in your car or truck to get more bars sounds great, but do signal boosters for cars actually work? And how do boosters compare to car Wi-Fi or dongles? After using one for nearly three years, here's what you need to know before you buy one.

##  What is a Phone Signal Booster?

![WeBoost signal booster how it works.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/580e27d9.jpg) 

_WeBoost_

 As the name suggests, a signal booster can amplify phone and internet connections from AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, etc., by using more powerful components than what's typically found in a smartphone. These cell phone boosters can find and amplify a weak signal to a more usable level. It doesn't create a signal for your phone, but it'll do a better job pulling in the service, thus making it available for you to use.

 Most boosters work with multiple network speeds (like 4G LTE/5G), meaning you'll get more bars to make a phone call or send a text and LTE for browsing the web or making video calls. They're popular accessories for truckers, RV users, and outdoor enthusiasts, and for good reason.

 After installing a [WeBoost signal booster](https://www.amazon.com/weBoost-Drive-470154-Signal-Booster/dp/B07PDVTMM6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002282&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fwhat-to-know-before-buying-a-car-phone-signal-booster%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) in my truck a few years ago, I can confidently say yes, yes, they do, and they work incredibly well. Instead of your phone trying to pull a signal through all the metal, glass, and aluminum of the vehicle's body, the booster has an outside antenna that does all the heavy lifting and then routes cell service inside the car for all occupants.

 Smartphones have tiny batteries, small modem chipsets for connecting to cell towers, and weak antennas. A signal booster in your car has more power from the vehicle's battery, a bigger antenna often located outside the car, and a signal amplifier.

 Not only did the signal booster I bought work, but it exceeded my expectations. I didn't just get cell service in locations where previously I couldn't even send a text message, but I had full 4G LTE. This made browsing the web, watching videos, or making a video call possible. For example, my family cabin in Zion National Park in southern Utah is 45 minutes from any major road. Most of the drive is a dead zone, with only one spot on the dirt road where I'll get a bar to send a text.

 After installing the WeBoost in my truck with the roof-mounted antenna and powerful amplifier, I now have 4G LTE for most of my drive. I get more bars in more places, increased speeds, and a better experience while traveling or camping. It's a significant difference.

 Another benefit of getting a signal booster is that most models on the market work with any carrier in the United States. They'll find and amplify any signal available instead of being limited to AT&T or Verizon.

 My weBoost supports all major network carriers in North America and is approved by the FCC and ISED. As a result, I get more bars and better service on my AT&T phone, all while friends or family using Verizon or another carrier experience similar boosts.

##  Signal Booster vs. In-Car Wi-Fi or 4G/5G Dongles

![AT&amp;T Spark for in-car internet and connectivity](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/faaa450d.jpg) 

_[AT&T](https://about.att.com/newsroom/2018/att%5Fharman%5Fconnected%5Fcar.html)_

 Many modern vehicles come with built-in 4G or 5G LTE, offering [occupants Wi-Fi inside](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-the-art-of-viewing-youtube-video-reactions-and-votes/). And while it works great around town, in-car Wi-Fi can often experience the same signal drops as a smartphone.

 Sure, your vehicle likely has a roof-mounted antenna that'll deliver slightly better results than a phone, but it's not a significant difference. As you travel into the woods, outside major cities, or across the country, you'll also lose service in your car. More importantly, in-car Wi-Fi typically uses a carrier like AT&T or T-Mobile for the connection, and that's the only option.

 With a signal booster, you have a device that can find and amplify any nearby signal. This is helpful if you have a cellular provider that differs from your vehicle, passengers that use a different company, or switch providers. So, while having an LTE or Wi-Fi-enabled vehicle is wonderful, a car signal booster gives you more options and is a better way to increase connectivity and speeds.

 Additionally, some carriers like [T-Mobile offer 4G dongles](https://obd-guide.cloud.sdp.prod.iot.sprint.com/#/home). You can plug it into a vehicle's OBDII port for cellular service, but they're not that great. These small low-power dongles have a tiny mobile chip inside and can't provide anything better than what you already get with a phone.

##  Who Should Buy a Cell Signal Booster

 So, who should buy a phone signal booster for their vehicle? I guess that depends on your wants, needs, and budget. They're a hefty investment, with many costing around $499\. That said, peace of mind is worth the price, especially in an emergency.

 If you're an avid outdoor enthusiast always wandering off the beaten path, you'll benefit from buying one. They're excellent accessories for truckers, RV owners, overlanders, going off-grid, and people living the Vanlife. Not only is a booster beneficial on long road trips, but it can help in the city, too, if you frequently deal with dead spots or cellular interference from buildings.

 It's important to remember that your results may vary depending on several factors, including installation location, region, carriers, and where you travel. Don't expect it to give you service anywhere and everywhere, as a booster can only catch and amplify a carrier signal. It doesn't create a cellular connection. I love mine, and I think many people would benefit from owning one.
