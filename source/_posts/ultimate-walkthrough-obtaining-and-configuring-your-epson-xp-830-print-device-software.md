 You can use iCUE to control RGB lighting effects on your mouse and fan speeds, temperature monitoring in the other compatible products.

 If your gaming mouse doesn’t work properly, for example, the lighting doesn’t work, you can reinstall the iCUE driver.

## What to do if your mouse still has issues?

 After reinstalling iCUE driver, if your gaming mouse still doesn’t work, you can use Driver Easy to update all drivers in your computer, as the problem can be caused by faulty drivers installed on your computer.

**[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing drivers.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can manually install the drivers (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
