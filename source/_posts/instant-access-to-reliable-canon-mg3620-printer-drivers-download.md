## Option 1 – Update the driver manually

**Zebra Technologies** **Corporation** keeps updating their GK420d drivers.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file (usually with the EXE extension) and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
