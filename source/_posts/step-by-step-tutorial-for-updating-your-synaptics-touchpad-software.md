## Step-by-Step Fixes for Your Graphic Card Drivers Warning

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nvidia.jpg)

 The NVIDIA error message “**Warning: Known issues with graphics driver** ” is getting in the way, but how do I fix it? Why am I getting the error anyway?

 “**Warning: Known issues with graphics driver** ” is a very common error for Fortnite players, and the reason why you getting it is your current driver version is causing your game to crash, lag, etc.

## How to fix ‘Known issues with graphics driver’?

 To fix this error, you will need to update your NVIDIA graphics driver to the latest (game-ready) version.

There are mainly two ways you can update the graphics driver:

## Option 1 – Manually

 Graphics card manufacturers will roll out graphics drivers optimized for the latest titles on a regular basis. You can download the most recent correct driver from the **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  driver download page and install it manually.

 Windows Update won’t deliver the latest version. That’s because it categorizes driver updates as either ‘critical’, ‘automatic’ or ‘optional’, and it doesn’t usually concern itself with the ‘optional’ ones.

 Therefore, we recommended that you update your graphics driver either manually or via GeForce Experience, or use a driver updater to do it automatically.
