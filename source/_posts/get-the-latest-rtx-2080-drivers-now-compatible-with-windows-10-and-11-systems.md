## Choose the way you prefer

 Both methods below work in **Windows 10** , **8** and **7** . You may not have to try both; just decide if you want to do it manually or automatically and take your pick:

1. [**Update your Brother MFC7360N driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your Brother MFC7360N driver automatically (Recommended)**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

**A WORD OF WARNING** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.
