### Option 1 – Update the drivers manually

 Lenovo keeps updating drivers for the T450 laptops. To get them, you need to visit the support website of Lenovo, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download the drivers manually. Here’s the details:

1. Go to the **[Drivers & Software page](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcsupport.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Flaptops-and-netbooks%2Fthinkpad-t-series-laptops%2Fthinkpad-t450%2Fdownloads%2Fdriver-list%2F) [](https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/ROG-MAXIMUS-X-HERO/HelpDesk%5FDownload/)**  of Lenovo T450 laptops.
2. Under the**Manual Update** tab, select your operating system. You can also sort the drivers by**Components** ,**Severity** , and**Release Date** if you want.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-27_19-12-26.jpg)
