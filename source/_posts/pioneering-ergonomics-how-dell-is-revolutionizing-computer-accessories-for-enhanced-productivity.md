## Pioneering Ergonomics: How Dell Is Revolutionizing Computer Accessories for Enhanced Productivity

Dell sells a lot of keyboards and mice, but most of them are basic accessories that aren’t competitive with options from Logitech and other companies. That’s starting to change, as Dell is introducing two new keyboards and an updated mouse.

 First, the company has released the [Dell Silent Keyboard and Mouse Combo (KM555)](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2004951%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-silent-keyboard-and-mouse-km555%2Fapd%2F580-bbsc%2Fpc-accessories). The keyboard is a standard 75% layout, with a dedicated number pad and a function row at the top. Key presses are intended to make as little noise as possible, making it ideal for shared workspaces or calls where a typical mechanical keyboard might annoy people. There’s also a [dedicated Microsoft Copilot key on the keyboard](https://techidaily.com/the-way-to-recover-deleted-pictures-on-infinix-without-backup-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/), like many recent PC laptops.

 The mouse has an adjustable DPI up to 4020, an ambidextrous design and a “programmable scroll wheel button” that you can customize with Dell’s Peripheral Manager software. There’s not really anything exciting or unusual here—it’s a mouse that does mouse stuff.

 Both the keyboard and mouse can wirelessly connect to a PC using a 2.4 GHz USB wireless adapter or Bluetooth 5.1\. They’re also rated for 36 months of battery life, and use “up to 64% post-consumer recycled plastic.”

 Dell also released the [Wired Collaboration Keyboard (KB525C)](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2004951%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-wired-collaboration-keyboard-kb525c%2Fapd%2F580-bbvb%2Fpc-accessories). It has dedicated keys for muting and unmuting your microphone, toggling video, sharing your screen, and opening the chat, all of which work in Microsoft Teams or Zoom. That requires Windows and the Dell Peripheral Manager software to be installed, though, and they won’t do anything in other apps unless they implement Dell’s API. You can also customize the shortcuts on the top row with Dell’s software.

 Besides the shortcut keys, the Wired Collaboration Keyboard is a standard full-size PC keyboard, with the same Copilot key as the other model. It has both USB Type-A and USB Type-C connectors on the cable, but the cord is permanently attached to the keyboard.

 You can buy the [Silent Keyboard and Mouse Combo](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2004951%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-silent-keyboard-and-mouse-km555%2Fapd%2F580-bbsc%2Fpc-accessories) for $50, or you can [get the mouse on its own](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2004951%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-silent-mouse-ms355%2Fapd%2F570-bbjd%2Fpc-accessories) for $30\. The [Wired Collaboration Keyboard](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU2004951%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-wired-collaboration-keyboard-kb525c%2Fapd%2F580-bbvb%2Fpc-accessories) is available for $35\. Hopefully, Dell will keep working on its accessories and give Logitech a run for its money.
