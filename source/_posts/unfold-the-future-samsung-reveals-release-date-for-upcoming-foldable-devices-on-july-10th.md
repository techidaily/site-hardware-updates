## Unfold the Future: Samsung Reveals Release Date for Upcoming Foldable Devices on July 10Th

Samsung already launched its Galaxy S24 series back in January, and they've been very solid phones. But if you follow Samsung's release cycle, you'll know those were not the only flagships Samsung had in store. Now, Samsung has revealed when we will see its next foldables, and they are really, really close.

 Samsung has just announced that its next Unpacked event will be taking place on July 10th in Paris, France. At the event, Samsung will announce the next entries in the Galaxy Z series of foldables, presumably the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy Z Flip 6\. Samsung also says that the "next frontier" of Galaxy AI is also coming as a part of this event, and we'll have to see whether that means more features, a superpowered AI large language model for the smartphones, both, or something else. Samsung tends to launch non-foldable flagships in the first half of the year and foldable phones by the second half, so it's safe to say things are going right according to schedule.

 As for the actual phones, we expect to see a similar kind of upgrade as the one we saw with the Galaxy S24\. The designs probably won't be significantly different than the previous generations, except with better internals, a lot of AI features, and potentially other improvements such as camera, display, or battery. Battery life is usually a weak point for foldables due to how they need to be designed, and we'd really love if we got some improvement in that regard. The [Galaxy Z Fold 5](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfecting-the-art-of-compelling-mosaic-imagery/) was a step in the right direction for battery life, but the Z Fold 6 could push the envelope even further. Of course, this is all just speculation. Both the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 have been present in the rumor mill, but we'll need to wait for any announcement from Samsung to know what's true or not.

 We're certainly excited to see what Samsung has in store for its next generation of foldables. We're just less than a month away from the event, so we won't have to wait long.
