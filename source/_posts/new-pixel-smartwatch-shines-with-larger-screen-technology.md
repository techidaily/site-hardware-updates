## New Pixel Smartwatch Shines with Larger Screen Technology

Google revealed the new Pixel Watch 3 at its Made by Google event on Tuesday. The company's third generation smartwatch is heavily geared towards helping runners train more efficiently and effectively, while still offering a slew of productivity and connectivity options.

 Both the original Pixel watch and [the Pixel Watch 2](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ractical-techniques-for-rapid-deletion-of-comments/) only came in a single size and one material: 41mm stainless steel. Though the Pixel Watch 3 uses the same aluminum shell as the Watch 2, the new iteration will be offered in both 41mm and 45mm screen sizes. And when combined with a 16 percent smaller bezel, the new 41mm Watch 3 offers 10 percent more screen area than its predecessor, while the 45mm version boasts a 40 percent screen area increase over the Watch 2\. What's more, the Watch 3 utilizes the same Actua display found in the Pixel 8 handsets. It can brighten up to 2,000 nits (double that of the Watch 2) and dim as low as 1 nit, with a dynamic refresh rate that modulates itself between 1 and 60Hz to maximize performance while balancing power usage.

The Pixel Watch 3 and Buds Pro 2 might look familiar, but Google gave the Pixel 9 series a bold new look.

 Both screen sizes are available as a Matte Black Aluminum case with an Obsidian band and a Polished Silver Aluminum with a Porcelain band. The larger, 45mm model also has a unique Matte Hazel Aluminum with a Hazel band option, while the 41mm version comes in both Champagne Gold Aluminum with a Hazel band and Polished Silver Aluminum with a Rose Quartz band.

 Altogether, the Pixel Watch 3 has an estimated 24-hour battery life when you run the always-on display. It can reportedly run up to 36 hours in Battery Saver mode, which turns on automatically once the battery level drops below 15 percent. The Watch 3 can also automatically detect when you go to sleep and enter Bedtime Mode, which turns off notifications and the always-on display.

 The Pixel Watch 3 comes with all the myriad heart rate, oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram, skin conductance and temperature sensors that its predecessor offered, and incorporates them into a new comprehensive running "experience." With it, you will be able to create running routines including interval training, incorporate timed warm-ups and cool downs, and set a target pace, heart rate, time, or distance.

 When you go for one of your routine runs, the Watch 3 will provide real-time performance guidance through both audio and haptic cues. It will alert you when your speed deviates from your target pace or heart rate as well as alert you to the start of the next interval cycle. Unlike the Watch 2, this iteration will also be able to seamlessly adjust audio playback volume and skip tracks, thanks to updated media controls. The Watch 3 can also critique your running form using motion sensing paired with machine learning algorithms to measure your cadence, stride length, and other aspects of your style.

Google

 Your weekly mileage, personal records and additional workout analysis stats are available in the new running dashboard of the Fitbit app. Google is offering six months free for the Fitbit Premium subscription with a purchase of the Watch 3\. The normally $10/month subscription leverages Google AI to root through your run history, readiness, and target cardio load to generate individualized daily run recommendations as well as insights and drill suggestions to further improve your performance. Readiness looks at your sleep, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability to help you maximize your recovery period while the Target Cardio Load metric shows how hard your heart is working throughout the day, enabling you to optimize your workouts and reduce injury risk from over-training.

 The Watch 3 will also provide a Morning Brief when you wake up in the morning. It details how well you slept, what your readiness score is, how far you've progressed in your weekly fitness goals and will alert you if any of your tracked biometric readings have deviated from the normal range. It'll even tell you what the weather is expected to be, so you'll know how many layers you'll need to wear on your run. The Pixel Watch 3 is no one-trick pony, mind youâ€”it does far more than just analyze your running routines. The Watch 3 is fully integrated into the Google ecosystem, including devices like your Pixel phone, Chromecast and Nest cameras and doorbells. You can use your Watch as a Google TV remote or a Dick Tracy-style videophone to get a live view of, and even have a two-way conversation with, whoever is outside your front door. Screen calls, take voice memos, and access Google Maps (even offline), all from your wrist.

 The Pixel Watch 3 will start at $349.99 for the 41mm model with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and the model with added LTE connectivity will cost $449.99\. The 45mm model with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi will be $399.99, and the LTE variant will be $499.99\. You can [pre-order the watch](https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5Fwatch%5F3) on Google's online store, and it will start shipping on September 10.
