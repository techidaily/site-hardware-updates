## Save Big on Your Dream Rig: The Stylish Fractal Design North Case at Just $119

I'm not kidding when I say this is one of my favorite-looking PC cases. Obviously, tastes are personal, but the meshing together of industrial metal and an organic natural-looking wood finish really work for me and lets the Fractal Design North mid-tower case take a position in your domicile without egregiously standing out like a sore thumb - not everyone wants a RGB EDM festival for a gaming PC and this case just adds a touch of class and for a good price too.

 The Fractal Design North has always been affordingly priced for what I deem to be a quality PC case, but when it's discounted it's a superb option for a classy-looking PC build.

 We at Tom's Hardware have had the opportunity to[review the Fractal Design North](https://tools.techidaily.com) with the case hitting home with our reviewer and being awarded an Editor's Choice Award for its many positives, which included great airflow, excellent thermal performance, gorgeous design, a moveable fan hub, included PWN fans and more. The only negative being some noise leakage from the internal components which you would expect from a case with multiple mesh panels.
