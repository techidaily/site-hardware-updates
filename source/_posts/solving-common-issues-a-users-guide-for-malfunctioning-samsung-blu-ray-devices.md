## Why you need to update the driver

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve it.

## How to download the Driver?

 Usually, there are two ways you can get the right drivers: manually and automatically.

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 To get the latest drivers, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

1. Go to the[Dell support website](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fsupport%2Fhome%2Fus%2Fen%2F19%3Fc%3Dus%26l%3Den%26%7Eck%3Dmn) .
2. Search for the product.
3. [Download](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fsupport%2Fhome%2Fus%2Fen%2F04%2FDrivers%2FDriversDetails%3FdriverId%3DCGGCK) and install the driver.
