## 2 options to update **HP ENVY 5660 drivers**

 Both methods below work in**Windows 10** ,**8.1**  and**7** . And as the method list suggests, you don’t have to try both. Just decide if you want to do it manually or automatically and take your pick:

1. **[Update HP ENVY 5660 driver automatically(Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/hp-envy-5660-driver-download-install-easily/#O1)**
2. **[Update HP ENVY 5660 driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Option 1: Update **HP ENVY 5660**  driver automatically (Recommended)

If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .**Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** or the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
