 Apple Notes syncs between devices for anyone with an Apple ID, which is required to use devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers. Unfortunately, there's no native app for Windows or Android users, but the web version can make a suitable substitute.

##  Turn on Apple Notes iCloud Sync

 If you use Apple Notes on an Apple device, first ensure you have iCloud sync enabled so that new notes and changes are pushed to all of your devices. This should be enabled by default, but it's good to check.

 On an iPhone or iPad you can do this under Settings > \[Your Name\] > iCloud by enabling the "Apple Notes" setting:

 On a Mac, this can be turned on under System Preferences > Apple ID by checking the "Notes" setting:

 When making notes, make sure that you are placing them in your iCloud folders since it's possible to have offline folders too that are device-specific:

 Once enabled, new notes will be placed in iCloud by default.

##  Access Apple Notes via iCloud in a Browser

 With your Mac, iPhone, and iPad now syncing Apple Notes to iCloud, you can access them using a web browser by heading to iCloud.com and logging in with your Apple ID.

![Sign in to iCloud](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sign_in_icloud.png) 

 You may need to pass a [two-factor authentication](https://howto.techidaily.com/spotify-keeps-crashing-a-complete-list-of-fixes-you-can-use-on-zte-nubia-z60-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) check, so make sure you choose to "Trust" this computer if you want to log in faster in the future. You should only trust personal computers and smartphones that you own, and never trust a computer or device that you share with others.

 Once you're in, click on "Notes" to see a web-based version of the Apple Notes app. You can use this to access and edit existing notes, create new ones, and share with other iCloud users.

 While you can access locked notes by entering your Apple ID password, you can't apply a lock to existing or new notes.

##  Turn iCloud Into an App on Windows or Android

 You can keep Apple Notes open in its own [pinned tab](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-guide-on-mirroring-your-honor-play-7t-to-your-pcmac-drfone-by-drfone-android/), but it may be more convenient to turn the web app into an application or shortcut you can run from your Start menu or Android home screen.

 On Windows you can [do this using Chrome or Edge](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-small-scale-streaming-mastery-on-youtube-without-big-subscriber-base/), [pin it to your taskbar](https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/understanding-the-five-main-causes-of-chatgpt-prohibitions-in-businesses/), and apply a custom icon if you like. You'll need to log in from time to time, but as long as you "Trust" the browser when entering your two-factor authentication code this process won't be quite as tedious.

 Android users can also [do this using Chrome](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/unova-stone-pokemon-go-evolution-list-and-how-catch-them-for-nokia-c12-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), which places a shortcut on your home screen. If you prefer a different browser, [Hermit](https://hermit.chimbori.com) is another Android app that can do this without Chrome and with the bonus of being lightweight.

 Apple Notes is just one service you can take advantage of using a browser.
