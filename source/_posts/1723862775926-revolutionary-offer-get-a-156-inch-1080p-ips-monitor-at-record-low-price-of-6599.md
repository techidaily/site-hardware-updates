 One of my favorite features of this monitor is the ability to still treat the monitor as if you have two screens on your desk. The 'Picture-by-Picture' mode splits the screen in half and lets you use two inputs at their native resolution, so you could have your PC and a console connected and view both sources at the same time - a great feature for streaming game content for example. For connectivity, you have 1 x HDMI 2.1 port, 1 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x micro HDMI 2.1, and a USB Hub.
