 The Lenovo Legion Slim 5 comes with 16GB of 5600MHz DDR5 RAM which is ample for most current gaming needs. Unfortunately the same can't be said for the 512GB SSD. Although enough for an operating system and a few applications, 512GB of storage is filled in next to no time when you look at the file size of modern AAA games. The SSD is definitely an area where you might want to consider upgrading in the future with something like a 2TB drive.
