![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-301.png)

 Have you ever run into an**XBOX ACC** issue? When you see this weird item, chances are that your Windows system fails to recognize the Xbox device, or to install the corresponding driver for it properly. In this case, you should try to update the Xbox adapter driver by yourself instead of relying on Windows to do it for you. Don’t panic if you are not sure how to update the so-called XBOX ACC driver (actually it’s just the driver for your Xbox device) – this post will get you out of trouble.

## How to download and install the XBOX ACC driver

 Generally there are two ways you can update your XBOX ACC adapter drivers:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-xbox-acc-driver-issues-on-windows-10-8-7/#option1) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.
