## Experience the Power of Oversized Capacity: TerraMaster's Impressive 128TB RAID Enclosure Explained

Professionals and hobbyists who deal with a boatload of data should check out the new TerraMaster D8 Hybrid, an eight-bay drive enclosure that combines HDD capacity with SSD speed. It looks impressive, and you can save $100 on your pre-order during TerraMaster's crowdfunding campaign.

 TerraMaster debuted its first hybrid drive enclosure, the [D5 Hybrid](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-do-you-remove-restricted-mode-on-iphone-12-by-drfone-ios/), earlier this year. It was an "industry first," utilizing a pair of HDDs and three M.2 NVMe SSDs for a fast and flexible mix of "[hot and cold](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-apps-from-honor-x50-to-another-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/)" storage. Files that you frequently access are kept on the SSDs, while the HDDs are used for backups or rarely-needed files.

 The new [D8 Hybrid](https://d8hybrid.terra-master.com/) enclosure takes things a bit further. It can accommodate four HDDs and four SSDs for a maximum 128TB of storage. Note that this is a drive enclosure, not a NAS device—it connects directly to your computer over USB 3.2 Gen 2 for blazing-fast file transfer up to 10Gbps. Alternatively, you can use the D8 Hybrid to expand a NAS device's storage. It only has one USB port, though, so it can only connect to a single computer or NAS—not both.

 Anyone who needs _this much_ storage probably wants some data redundancy. The D8 Hybrid always leaves its M.2 SSDs in Single Disk mode, meaning that they're treated as a large, ultra-fast storage pool. If you set the slower HDDs to RAID 1, they'll mirror the contents of your SSDs and serve as a backup in case of a drive failure. Those who prefer to maximize both storage capacity and speed can choose between RAID 0, Single Disk, or JBOD modes.

 The D8 Hybrid also includes a unique 2+6 RAID mode. In this configuration, two of your HDDs serve as RAID backups while your remaining drives operate in Single Disk fashion. This gives you a nice mix of redundancy and storage, and it provides some wiggle room when selecting drive capacities.

 As for how you interact with the D8 Hybrid—well, you treat it like a massive external drive. TerraMaster also offers its TPC Backupper software for Windows users, but Linux or macOS users who want automated backups need to use a different application, such as [rsync](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-downgrade-iphone-6-plus-without-data-loss-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/) or [Time Machine](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/can-life360-track-or-see-text-messages-what-can-you-do-with-life360-on-realme-gt-5-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

 While I love TerraMaster's hybrid approach to hot and cold data storage, the D8 Hybrid is overkill for most people. Some professionals and hobbyists may be better off with the smaller [D5 Hybrid](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-do-you-remove-restricted-mode-on-iphone-12-by-drfone-ios/), and those who don't need RAID redundancy or a massive amount of storage can simply buy a [drive enclosure](https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/the-most-effective-ways-to-bypass-apple-iphone-14-activation-lock-by-drfone-ios/) or pre-assembled [external drive](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-comparing-reels-and-stories-whats-your-preference/).

 TerraMaster is now accepting [D8 Hybrid pre-orders](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/64664914/terramaster-d8-hybrid) on Kickstarter. Early customers can secure their pre-order for $199, which is $100 off MSRP. Note that this is just the price of the _enclosure_; you need to buy the drives separately.
