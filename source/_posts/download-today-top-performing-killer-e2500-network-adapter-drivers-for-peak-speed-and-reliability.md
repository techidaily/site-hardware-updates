## Why do you need the Insignia USB to ethernet adapter driver?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, and so are drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve them.
