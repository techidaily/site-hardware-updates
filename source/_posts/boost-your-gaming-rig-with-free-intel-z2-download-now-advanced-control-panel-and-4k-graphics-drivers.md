 Having an issue with your AMD video card? Don’t worry. You can update your**AMD video driver** to the latest version to fix any graphics issues, and bring you the best possible experience, especially when playing PC games.

 This post will show you three methods to download and update AMD graphics card driver quickly and easily.

## Download and Update AMD video driver for Windows 10/8/7

1. [Download your AMD video driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Update your AMD video driver automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Update your AMD video driver in Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Download your AMD video driver manually

 As one of the biggest manufacturers of graphics cards, you can download the latest version of your AMD graphics driver from the AMD website:

 1) Go to[AMD support and download center](https://support.amd.com/en-us/download) .

 2) You’ll see two entrances:**Automatically Detect and Install Your Driver** , and**Manually Select Your Driver** .

3) Select the latest driver that is matched with your system to download.
