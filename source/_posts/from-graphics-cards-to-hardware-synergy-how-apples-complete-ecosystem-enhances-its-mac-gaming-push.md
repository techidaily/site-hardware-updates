 We had the opportunity to review another higher-end model of the[Asus ROG Zephyrus G14](https://tools.techidaily.com) and were overall pleased with the experience. However, we weren't completely floored, rating it at 3.5 out of 5 stars. It's important to note that there are a few key differences between the edition we reviewed and the model that's on sale today so some of the points, like GPU performance, won't apply.

 What is the same, however, was the OLED 2880 x 1800 screen (Best Buy lists the screen as 2560 x 1440 but this appears to be a mistake on Best Buy's part). As you can see, it's very bright and fairly colorful.

 We found the keyboard solid if unimpressive and the[audio](https://tools.techidaily.com) output was really good. We also appreciated the wide variety of ports, which including USB 4 Type-C, USB 3.2 Gen Type-A, HDMI and a headphone jack.
