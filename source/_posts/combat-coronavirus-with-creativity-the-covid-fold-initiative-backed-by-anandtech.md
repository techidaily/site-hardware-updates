 We're kicking off the second annual Folding@Home Competition between AnandTech and Tom's Hardware on Monday, March 12.

 Fold for charity. Fold for pride. Fold at home in our second annual Folding@Home competition between AnandTech Forums and the Tom's Hardware Community. This isn't the official announcement; that will come Monday. In the meantime, we wanted all of our Tom's Hardware members to know we're ready to go. Here are some links to get you started:
