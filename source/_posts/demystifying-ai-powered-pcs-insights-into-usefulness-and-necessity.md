## Starting From Just $1,099: Acer, Dell, HP & Lenovo Launch Snapdragon X Windows Copilot PCs With Extended Multi-Day Battery

At today's Windows and devices event, partner OEMs opened the floodgates for new thin and light laptops using Qualcomm's Snapdragon X family of Arm processors. While Qualcomm has released Arm chips in the past, running[Windows on Arm](https://tools.techidaily.com) , this is the first time it has hardware that is truly powerful enough to take on current-generation mobile chips from Intel, AMD, and even Apple.

 Not only does the new Snapdragon X family seem to offer compelling performance and efficiency coupled with long runtimes, but it also features a powerful Hexagon Neural Processing Unit (NPU) that is the focal point of the[Windows 11](https://tools.techidaily.com) AI revolution and is capable of 45 TOPS compute. The NPU can efficiently process tasks such as image editing, text-to-image generation, and text creation on-device without the need for the cloud.

 Before we get into the specifics about the new laptops that have been announced, let’s first give you a brief specs overview of the Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus chips that power these machines. You can[read our comprehensive overview](https://tools.techidaily.com) of the new Arm processor family for more details.

## Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x 14 Gen 9 and ThinkPad 14s Gen 6

 Next, we have the Yoga Slim 7x 14 Gen 9 from the Lenovo camp. Manufacturers often talk about "all-day" battery life with their thin and light[notebooks](https://tools.techidaily.com) , but Lenovo claims that the Yoga Slim 7x extends that to "multi-day battery life." The efficient Snapdragon X Elite processor is paired with up to 32GB of LPDDR5x and includes a 70 WHr battery to enable this long endurance.

| **Price**              | Starts at $1,199                  | Starts at $1,699          |

 The Yoga Slim 7x 14 Gen 9 can be configured with up to 1TB of storage. It also has three USB-C ports (40 Gbps with DisplayPort 1.4 support), Wi-Fi 7 networking onboard, and Bluetooth 5.3 support.

 The Yoga Slim 7x 14 Gen 9 weighs 2.82 pounds and measures 12.80 x 8.86 x 0.51 inches. For reference, a[15-inch MacBook Air](https://tools.techidaily.com) weighs 3.3 pounds and measures 13.40 x 9.35 x 0.45 inches. The 15-inch MacBook Air also comes with a slightly smaller 66.5 WHr battery.

 The ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 joins the Yoga Slim 7x in the Snapdragon X Elite arena but is specifically geared toward business customers. As a result, the laptop supports up to 64GB of LPDDR5x memory and supports the latest Wi-Fi 7 standard (along with Bluetooth 5.3). In addition, you can opt for a 5G modem if you need access when you're out in the field away from Wi-Fi hotspots. Despite a smaller (compared to the Yoga Slim 7x) 58 WHr battery, Lenovo still claims the ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 can achieve multi-day battery life.

Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6  (Image credit: Qualcomm)

 Lenovo provides three display options with the ThinkPad T14s Gen 6: the first two are 14-inch 400-nit IPS panels with a 1920 x 1200 resolution, but one supports touch, and the other doesn't. The third option is a 2.8K OLED panel with 100% coverage of DCI-P3 and VESA HDR True Black 500 compliance.

 The ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 also changes things up with available features and ports. On the[security](https://tools.techidaily.com) front, the 1080p webcam on the ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 gains a privacy shutter, and a fingerprint reader is integrated into the power button. It also has only two USB-C ports compared to the Yoga Slim 7x 14 Gen 9's three, but you gain two USB-A ports for legacy devices and an HDMI 2.1 port.

 The ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 measures 12.34 x 8.64 x 0.67 inches and weighs 2.72 pounds. Those dimensions line up almost perfectly with those of the ThinkPad T14s Gen 5, which is powered by Intel Core Ultra 5 and Core Ultra 7 processors.

 According to Lenovo, the Yoga Slim 7x and ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 will debut next month, priced from $1,199 and $1,699, respectively.

## Dell XPS 13, Inspiron 14 Plus, and Latitude 7455

 Dell’s lineup of Snapdragon X laptops[leaked early last week](https://tools.techidaily.com) , so things here should look somewhat familiar. The XPS 13 has a striking design, with a keyboard that goes nearly to the left and right edge of the CNC-machined aluminum chassis (available in Platinum or Graphite). You'll also find the controversial capacitive touch function row above the keyboard, which we discussed in our[reviews of the XPS 14 and XPS 16](https://tools.techidaily.com) . The haptic touchpad is also seamlessly integrated into the keyboard deck, which is covered in Gorilla Glass 3.
