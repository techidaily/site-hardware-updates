## Software Glitches Cause Setbacks in Sonos' Latest Hardware Launch

Sonos has had to delay two hardware releases, initially penciled in for late-2024, as it diverts its resources to overcoming issues with its redesigned app. One of those releases is reported to be a groundbreaking soundbar, which might have to wait until 2025 before it can sit on stores' shelves.

 Sonos reported an unaudited revenue of $397.1 million in its third-quarter fiscal highlights, largely thanks to unprecedented success with the launch of its [Ace headphones](https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/conveying-deep-emotions-in-magyar-language/) earlier in the year. However, [this success](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/nvidia-geforce-optimized-drivers-for-windows-download-now/) has been dampened somewhat by "stubborn bugs" that the company had not encountered during its new app's testing phase. CEO Patrick Spence hinted that the company's drive to unveil new software as quickly as possible has led to such a setback, admitting that his "push for speed backfired."

 This follows an [apology in July](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/3-facts-you-need-to-know-about-screen-mirroring-vivo-s18-pro-drfone-by-drfone-android/), in which Spence told customers that "there isn't an employee at Sonos who isn't pained" by letting them down, assuring users that "fixing the app for all of our customers and partners has been and continues to be the priority." Indeed, Sonos has a [tainted history with its app roll-outs](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-pro-drone-experience-a-thorough-look-at-dji-phantom-4/), presenting customers with clunky, unintuitive interfaces and connectivity problems in recent years.

 Issues with the new app include its generally laggy performance, the absence of some features that Sonos customers have become accustomed to relying on, problems with editing music queues, and temporary cloud outages. Spence acknowledged the reputational damage that the company's hastiness might have caused, stating that he's keen to get "customers raving about Sonos again." What's more, customers who were looking to purchase their first Sonos products are [wondering whether they should delay their investment](https://en.community.sonos.com/ask-a-question-228987/should-i-wait-to-buy-my-first-sonos-because-of-the-app-trouble-6901574), given the inevitable issues that will come with using the associated app.

 Spence also defended the issues that Sonos has faced with its app, suggesting that its "modular developer platform based on modern programming languages" that will enable it to "drive more innovation faster" has led to the untimely issues. Nonetheless, he concedes that "far too many customers are having an experience that is worse than what they previously had," leading the firm to rely on the expertise of Nick Millington, its Chief Innovation Officer, giving him the reign "to do whatever it takes to address the issues."

 In an attempt to appease its customers, and thank them for "sticking with" the company, Sonos has committed to rolling out bi-weekly updates once the issues are fixed, as well as "enacting programs" that might see promotions and discounts in the coming months.
