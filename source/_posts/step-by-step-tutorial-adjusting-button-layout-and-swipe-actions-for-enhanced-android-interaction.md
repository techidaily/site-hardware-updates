 Many Android phones these days come with fancy full-screen navigation gestures. Maybe you don't like them or want to try the other options. We'll show you how to change the navigation buttons on Android easily.

 Unfortunately, not all Android phones put the navigation button settings in the same place. In this guide, we'll show you how it works for both Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel devices.

##  Change Navigation Buttons on a Samsung Galaxy Phone

 First, on your Samsung Galaxy, swipe down once from the top of the screen and tap the gear icon.

 Next, select "Display" from the Settings menu.

![select display](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_20231011_111716_settings.jpg) 

 Scroll through the settings and tap "Navigation Bar" toward the bottom.

 Typically, Samsung Galaxy phones will have two choices:

* **Buttons**: Three buttons for "Recents," "Home," and "Back."
* **Swipe Gestures**: Swipe up to go Home, swipe up and hold for Recents, and swipe from the left or right to go Back.

 Additionally, you can tap "More Options" to customize the gestures.

 From here, you can add gesture bars to the three-button layout and adjust the gesture sensitivity.

 That's all there is to it for Samsung devices!

##  How to Swap Navigation Button Order on Samsung Galaxy

 Samsung defaults to using three-button navigation with the Back button on the right side. This is opposite to how every other Android phone maker does it, and it can feel strange to go "back" from the right when the arrow is pointing left. So let's fix it.

 First, swipe down once from the top of the screen and tap the gear icon.

![open the shade and tap the gear icon](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_20231011_111707_nova-launcher.jpg) 

 Next, select "Display" from the Settings menu.

![select display](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_20231011_111716_settings.jpg) 

 Scroll through the settings and tap "Navigation Bar" toward the bottom.

![select navigation bar](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_20231011_111727_settings.jpg) 

 With "Buttons" selected as the Navigation Type, scroll down and choose the button order that you prefer.

 Easy as that!

##  Change Navigation Buttons on a Google Pixel Phone

 On a Google Pixel smartphone, first, swipe down twice from the top of the screen to reveal the Quick Settings toggles and tap the gear icon.

![open the shade and tap the gear icon](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_20231011-110809.png) 

 Next, go to the "System" section in the Settings menu.

![select system](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_20231011-110815.png) 

 Now, select "Gestures."

![select gestures](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_20231011-110820.png) 

 The one that we want is "System Navigation."

![go to system navigation](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_20231011-110829.png) 

 You'll have two navigation options to choose from:

* **Gesture Navigation**: Swipe up to go Home, swipe up and hold for Recents, and swipe from the left or right to go Back.
* **3-Button Navigation**: Three buttons for "Recents," "Home," and "Back."

![navigation choices](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_20231011-110841.png) 

 Lastly, if you use Gesture Navigation, you can tap the gear icon to adjust the sensitivity of the Back gesture.
