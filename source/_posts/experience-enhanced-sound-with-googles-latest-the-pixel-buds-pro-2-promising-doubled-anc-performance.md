## Experience Enhanced Sound with Google's Latest - The Pixel Buds Pro 2 Promising Doubled ANC Performance

Is this what you wanted to hear? The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are now available for pre-order. They boast a more comfortable design, improved noise cancelation, and a brand-new Tensor A1 processor.

 It's rare to see a company brag about a wireless earbud chipset, so let's start there. Tensor A1 is a Google-made chipset that boosts ANC quality and music quality while (supposedly) delivering new AI functionality. The name "Tensor A1" is clearly a reference to Google's [Tensor G-series](https://howto.techidaily.com/8-ultimate-fixes-for-google-play-your-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-isnt-compatible-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) smartphone processor, which debuted in 2020 as an AI-focused alternative to Snapdragon. These aren't the first Pixel earbuds to use an in-house chipset—in fact, the original Pixel Buds Pro ran on an unnamed Google processor.

The Pixel Watch 3 and Buds Pro 2 might look familiar, but Google gave the Pixel 9 series a bold new look.

 Tensor A1 is at the core of Pixel Buds Pro 2's new Silent Seal 2.0 active noise-cancelation technology. Silent Seal 2.0 can filter out two times more noise than previous ANC algorithms, and it's far better at canceling the high-pitched noises (like clinking silverware) that tend to poke through ANC. Unfortunately, Google hasn't provided the effective frequency range for Silent Seal 2.0.

 The Tensor A1 processor also features a split signal path to separate music processing from the ANC algorithm. This gives users an "unaltered, pure sound" without compromising noise cancelation. While I'm sure that the added signal path makes a difference, the quality loss associated with ANC is usually blamed on [the _physical_ process](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-sharing-twitch-on-your-fb-page-for-2024/) of active noise cancelation. So, I doubt that this trick fully resolves quality loss in ANC mode.

 A more substantial audio quality improvement may be hidden in the Pixel Buds Pro 2's new high-frequency chamber, which will theoretically provide a smoother, less tinny sound. Plus, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 sport rubber wingtips (a carryover from [Pixel A-series buds](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-funnyframefarm-digital-jokes-galore/)) for a more secure fit. This was my most requested feature, as earbuds with wingtips don't need to be readjusted every time I smile or yawn. The original Pixel Buds Pro constantly wanted to creep out of my ears and often leaked sound, which compromised ANC performance.

 As for new software features, Pixel Buds Pro 2 offers an AI-powered Conversation Detection technology and Find My Device compatibility. Conversation Detection automatically kicks the earbuds into Transparency mode when you start talking to someone (and, importantly, it goes back to ANC when the conversation is over). The Find My Device integration is somewhat rudimentary, as there's no mmWave precision locating feature, but you can make the earbuds or charging case beep if they're lost in a couch cushion.

 The Conversation Detection feature comes with one awful caveat—it only works on new Pixel smartphones and tablets (barring A-series phones). I'm not sure why this limitation exists. Each earbud contains a magical AI tensor chip, so why does a smartphone need to be involved in the headlining AI feature?

 Other specs and features are basically unchanged. Pixel Buds Pro 2 offers multipoint Bluetooth device switching, Qi wireless charging, and fast pairing, just like its predecessor. That said, Google managed to score IP54 dust and water protection certification for the buds (IPX4 for the charging case), and it pushed the Pixel Buds Pro 2's battery life to 8 hours with ANC enabled. Add that to the charging case's 22-hour battery, and you've got a total 30-hour battery life with ANC.

 The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 cost $229 and are [now available for pre-order](https://store.google.com/us/?hl=en-US), with the release date set for September 26th.
