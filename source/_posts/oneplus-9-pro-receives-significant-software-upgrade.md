## OnePlus 9 Pro Receives Significant Software Upgrade

###### [Read update](https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/designing-efficient-auto-subscribe-web-addresses-for-2024/) 

* This article previously stated that Android 13 was coming to the Nothing Phone 1 for the first time, but the phone received Android 13 with [the Nothing OS 1.5 update in February 2023](https://us.nothing.tech/blogs/news/upgrade-to-nothing-os-1-5-powered-by-android-13). We apologize for the error.

 Nothing, the tech company founded by OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, released the original [Nothing Phone](https://howto.techidaily.com/fixes-for-apps-keep-crashing-on-vivo-s17e-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) in 2022, and a sequel arrived earlier this year. Now, the newer software features from the latest phone are coming to the original version, with the rollout of Nothing OS 2.0.

 This update brings the older phone up to par with the newer phone's software. The official changelog includes a new weather app, refined camera interface, "up to 50% increase in app loading speed," a new sound pack with additional Glyph ringtones and notification sounds, more Material You color schemes. You can also set new lock screen shortcuts, for either the camera, flashlight, device controls, or wallet. There's also a pile of bug fixes and performance improvements, and the same features you get with any Android 13 smartphone.

 With [Android 14](https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/beginners-pathway-to-russian-currency-terminology/) on the horizon, many companies are already devoting resources to porting and releasing that update to their phones as soon as possible, [such as Samsung](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-it-motorola-defy-2-wont-turn-on-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/). Nothing is currently testing [the Android 14 beta](https://us.nothing.tech/blogs/news/nothing-os-android-14-beta) for the Phone 1, which is great to see. The phone was previously updated to Android 13 with the Nothing OS 1.5 update back in February.

 It is still something that prospective buyers should be aware of, and we should probably keep an eye on how well, or how badly, Nothing fares while actually rolling out the stable Android 14 update to both the Phone 1 and the Phone 2\. The company's update policy is up to par with what many other companies have, promising three major OS updates and four years of security updates, but the company didn't really make any promises about how quicklythose updates would be released.

 The update is now currently rolling out to Nothing Phone 1 buyers now, although it may take a few weeks for it to reach everyone.
