 The Roccat Pyro uses the TTC Red linear mechanical switches (very similar to Cherry Reds), which have a 45g operating force, a 2mm actuation point, and a 4mm total travel distance. The keyboard has full-key rollover, which is essential for a gaming keyboard where multiple key inputs need to be recorded at the same time.

 Connectivity comes via a wired USB Type-A cable, with no extra luxuries such as a USB passthrough or audio port located on the keyboard. We've also had the opportunity to[review the Roccat Pyro](https://tools.techidaily.com) and gave it 3 stars. We liked the unique aesthetic, vertical volume knob, and two inputs on a single key, thanks to the Easy-Shift feature. Things we weren't so fond of were the software feeling outdated, lack of macro support, and no option for clicky or tactile switches. But what you get for $34 is a bit of a no-brainer if you're looking for a new budget keyboard.
