## Why should I update the Epson NX420 driver?

 The printer driver runs on your operating system, and enables it to communicate with the printer you use. Your printer won’t fully function if its driver hasn’t been properly installed on your computer. Also, printer issues such as blank page printing, error code messages, etc. occur when your printer driver is corrupted or outdated. So, we always recommend you keep your Epson NX420 driver updated for security and stability.
