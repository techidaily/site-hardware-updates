## Get the Sleek Look with a Steal: Fractal Design North PC Case for Only $119

I'm not kidding when I say this is one of my favorite-looking PC cases. Obviously, tastes are personal, but the meshing together of industrial metal and an organic natural-looking wood finish really work for me and lets the Fractal Design North mid-tower case take a position in your domicile without egregiously standing out like a sore thumb - not everyone wants a RGB EDM festival for a gaming PC and this case just adds a touch of class and for a good price too.

 The Fractal Design North has always been affordingly priced for what I deem to be a quality PC case, but when it's discounted it's a superb option for a classy-looking PC build. You can pick up the[Fractal Design North mid-tower PC case for $119 from B&H Photo](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1752176-REG/fractal%5Fdesign%5Ffd%5Fc%5Fnor1c%5F01%5Fnorth%5Fmid%5Ftower%5Fatx%5Fcase.html?BI=20811&KBID=16572&SID=tomshardware-us-1724593585720031288) or[Newegg](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3Dtomshardware-us-1410609249251237743%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fp%252FN82E16811352206) for this reduced sale price, saving around $20 - $30 off of the usual retail MSRP.

 We at Tom's Hardware have had the opportunity to[review the Fractal Design North](https://tools.techidaily.com) with the case hitting home with our reviewer and being awarded an Editor's Choice Award for its many positives, which included great airflow, excellent thermal performance, gorgeous design, a moveable fan hub, included PWN fans and more. The only negative being some noise leakage from the internal components which you would expect from a case with multiple mesh panels.
