 We[reviewed the Lancool III](https://tools.techidaily.com) RGB, awarding it an Editor's Choice award. The Lancool III was roomy with excellent cable management, although with all the large fans and airflow - it could also be a little noisy at times, but this should be nothing that some tweaks to fan curves couldn't cure.

 One of the great features of this PC case is the ability to move the front IO to the bottom of the case, which is super handy if you're one of the many PC users who like to have the case on the desk for easy access. Plus, the IO cabling is made super easy with all the cables grouped into a single adapter to plug straight into the motherboard - making one of the most fiddly parts of PC construction a breeze.

 At this price, you get a lot of case for the money, but the downside is that this is a short sale, and you won't have long to decide if this is the case for you.
