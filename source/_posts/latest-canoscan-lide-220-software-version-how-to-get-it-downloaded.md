## Why you need HP Photosmart 7520 printer drivers

 HP Photosmart 7520 printer is a powerful printer that delivers high-quality types of documents. It can double-sided printing documents, scanning, fax, and work almost silently. Perfect for business and family printing. To make it work smoothly, you’ll need to install its driver.  
 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both systems and devices are updating to catch up with the changing world, and so are drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.
