 When you rename your hotspot, you can choose any name you want. Keep in mind, though, that any devices that have saved your network's password will have to re-enter the password. That's because those devices consider your renamed hotspot a new wireless network.

##  Modify the Hotspot Name on an iPhone

 To change your iPhone's hotspot name, you'll have to [change your phone's name](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/fast-facial-masking-on-piscart-a-convenient-guide-for-2024/). This is because Apple doesn't allow you to use a dedicated name for your mobile hotspot. It uses your phone's name as the hotspot name.

 To make that change, then first, launch Settings on your iPhone. In Settings, choose General > About.

![Select &quot;About.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1-iphone-about.png) 

 In "About," select "Name."

![Choose "Name."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2-iphone-name.png) 

 On the "Name" page, tap your existing name and clear it. Then, enter your new name.

 When you're done, in the top-left corner, tap "About" to go back to the previous screen.
