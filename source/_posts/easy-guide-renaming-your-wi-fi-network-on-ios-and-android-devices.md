 To make your mobile hotspot appear with a different name on other devices, you can modify [your hotspot's name](https://www.reviewgeek.com/104805/the-best-funny-wi-fi-names-for-your-new-router/) on both your iPhone and your Android phone. We'll show you how to do that.

 When you rename your hotspot, you can choose any name you want. Keep in mind, though, that any devices that have saved your network's password will have to re-enter the password. That's because those devices consider your renamed hotspot a new wireless network.

##  Modify the Hotspot Name on an iPhone

 To change your iPhone's hotspot name, you'll have to [change your phone's name](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/fast-facial-masking-on-piscart-a-convenient-guide-for-2024/). This is because Apple doesn't allow you to use a dedicated name for your mobile hotspot. It uses your phone's name as the hotspot name.

 To make that change, then first, launch Settings on your iPhone. In Settings, choose General > About.

![Select &quot;About.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1-iphone-about.png) 

 In "About," select "Name."

![Choose "Name."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2-iphone-name.png) 

 On the "Name" page, tap your existing name and clear it. Then, enter your new name.

 When you're done, in the top-left corner, tap "About" to go back to the previous screen.
