 One of the best things about building your own PC is that you can put those components in just about anything as long as it prevents your parts from shorting out. Case manufacturers have certainly taken advantage of this, with some of these weird and wonderful cases.

## 1  DeepCool Tristellar 

![Deepcool Tristellar S Mod Signature Model](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/deepcool-tristellar-signature-model.jpeg) 

DeepCool

 The [Tristellar](https://www.deepcool.com/company/pressroom/newsrelease/2020/4259.shtml?id=PressRoom)family of cases really had the sort of sci-fi vibe I love the most, and there's a practical purpose behind the design of this chassis as well. The three different sections of the PC are each isolated, so the thermals from your GPU wont' affect your CPU, or your PSU, for example. This uses a mini-ITX motherboard, but otherwise you can use full-size components to your heart's content. Through clever use of risers and extension cables it all works, and honestly if I could still track one of these down for a decent price I'd still consider it for a build.

## 2  DeepCool Quadstellar Infinity 

![DeepCool Quadstelalr Infinity](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/deepcool-quadstelalr-infinity.jpg) 

DeepCool

 The [QuadStellar](https://www.deepcool.com/company/pressroom/newsrelease/2020/4303.shtml) is basically the TriStellar, but one better. It might not be quite as radical-looking, but it's definitely got plenty of the same desktop spaceship vibe going for it. It keeps the compartmentalized design idea from the TriStellar, but now accommodates E-ATX motherboards. Just as with its three-pointed sibling, the QuadStellar offers compartments that isolate major components and allow for optimal cooling, but also goes all out with the liquid cooling options, letting you set up multiple radiators. The extra compartment can be used exclusively for SSDs and HDDs, so it was actually not a bad choice for creatives or professionals who needed lots of storage housed and cooled properly.

## 3  Lian-Li PC T1R 

![Lian Li PC T1R](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lian-li-pc-t1r.jpeg) 

Lian-Li

 As an avowed [arachnophile](https://win11.techidaily.com/hacking-the-lock-screen-windows-11-edition/), and fan of cyberpunk spider tanks, the T1R immediately appealed to me. I've always wanted to run a test-bench open-air system, but ultimately decided not to because of the very real chance that my cat or a glass of soda would end my PC's existence. Still, this is a great design for anyone who does hardware testing.

## 4  Thermaltake Level 10 GT 

![Thermaltake Level 10 GT](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/thermaltake-level-10-gt.jpg) 

ThermalTake

 When this case was announced back in 2011, there was no way I could afford it, or the components that justified owning it, but it was clearly the Rolls-Royce of PC cases. The Level 10 GT is humangous, and designed specifically to maximize cooling and minimize noise. What's even crazier, is that this was the [more affordable version](https://tools.techidaily.com/anandtech/products/) of the original level 10!

## 5  Corsair Graphite 380T (I Bought This One) 

![Corsair Graphite 380T](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/corsair-graphite-380t.jpeg) 

Corsair

 Of all the cases on this list, it's the 380T that I actually bought with my own money. This was my second mini-ITX build, and I stuffed this portable mesh case with a liquid-cooled 4690K CPU and a massive R9 390 GPU. After swapping out the 140MM front fan for a 200MM model, it honestly looked like something from the Death Star's server room. I loved the car door handles that opened the side panels, and I actually did schlep this to work a few times for special presentation and VR projects.

## 6  Cooler Master Sneaker X 

![Cooler Master Sneaker X](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cooler-master-sneaker-x.jpeg) 

Cooler Master

 I will fully confess that I do not understand the [sneakerhead phenomenon](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattpowell/2014/05/21/sneakernomics-are-sneakerheads-important/), but people love the design of sneakers so much that Cooler Master figured why not make a [PC case that looks like a shoe](https://www.coolermaster.com/en-global/products/sneaker-x/)?

 Now, it actually ends up looking more like a robot's foot, but there's zero chance you won't be attracing attention at the [LAN party](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/how-to-resolve-windows-upgrade-failures-and-errors/) if you show up with this thing in tow!

## 7  Thermaltake Core P90 

![Thermaltake Core P90](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/thermaltake-core-p90.jpeg) 

ThermalTake

 Glass corner or "fishtank" cases are all the rage today, but the P90 from Thermaltake strips that idea down into its basics and gives you a two-faced glass case, but without the actual case panels. This is as close to a modern art piece as a PC case has ever come, and if I didn't dread having to keep it clean, I might even have considered it, assuming my bank account could justify it.

## 8  HP Omen X 

![HP Omen X](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/hp-omen-x.jpeg) 

HP

 We are HP, surrender your wallets. We will add your PC components to our case. Resistance is futile.

## 9  COUGAR Conquer 

![COUGAR Conquer](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cougar-conquer.png) 

COUGAR

 I've actually seen one of these [COUGAR Conquer](https://cougargaming.com/products/cases/conquer/) cases in person, and this is one of the few cases on this list that you can readily buy at the time of writing. It's even more beautiful than the photos suggest, and it looks like it will leap off your desk at a moments notice. The main impression I get is "Lambo PC", but without the actual license to use the branding. It's a singular, _angular_ masterpiece and I'd rather have this than the boring fishtanks everyone shows off these days any time.

## 10  The Hydra Desk 

![The Hydra Desk](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/the-hydra-desk.png) 

HYDRA

 If you don't intend on taking your computer anywhere inbetween house moves, the [Hydra Desk](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpromotions.newegg.com%2Fmarketplace%2F2017%2F17-8195%2Flp%2Findex.html) kills two birds with one expensive PC desk and chassic combo. Somehow, it manages to be both ridiculously extravagant, while also being minimalist as all heck.

 In the words of Tony Stark: "I need it."
