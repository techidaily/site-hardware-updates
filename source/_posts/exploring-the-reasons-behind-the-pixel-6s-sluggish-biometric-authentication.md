## Exploring the Reasons Behind the Pixel 6'S Sluggish Biometric Authentication

While the [Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro have received mostly positive reviews](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/top-apps-and-online-tools-to-track-itel-p55t-phone-withwithout-imei-number-by-drfone-android/), the devices aren't without problems. The fingerprint scanner is slow, and Google appears to have an excuse for the problem.A user on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1457043416139898881?ref%5Fsrc=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1457043416139898881%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1%5Fc10&ref%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F7%2F22768853%2Fgoogle-explains-pixel-6-fingerprint-scanner-unreliable) asked Google about the Pixel 6 fingerprint scanner and why it's slower than expected. A representative of the company responded and said, "We're sorry for the hassle. The Pixel 6 fingerprint sensor utilizes enhanced security algorithms. In some instances, these added protections can take longer to verify or require more direct contact with the sensor."

 The Google representative also pointed to a [support page](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6285273), though the page doesn't offer much help regarding the fingerprint scanner.

 It sounds like Google is trying to justify the sluggish [fingerprint scanner](https://techidaily.com/turn-off-screen-lock-a60-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/) as a byproduct of extra security measures. That may be true, but it's hard to say for sure since not all Pixel 6 owners are complaining about the problem, leading us to believe that it may be a software issue affecting some users.

 If it does end up being a software problem, hopefully, it's something Google can speed up with a patch at some point. If it's hardware, then it might just be an issue [Pixel 6](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/unblocking-windows-upgrade-error-xc004f050-code/) owners are forced to deal with. If they can't deal with the slow fingerprint scanner, they might have to use their pins to unlock their devices.
