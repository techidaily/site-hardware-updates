## Why do you need to update the T300 drivers?

 Driver functions as a translator between your device and operating system. Your operating system and your device don’t actually speak the same language. When your operating system gives a command to your device, your device can not understand it. Therefore, your operating system and your device need a translator. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices but drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

This is why most of the problems can be solved by updating drivers.

### Method 2: Update the driver automatically

 If you don’t have time or computer skills to manually update your drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. In other words, you don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. You can choose to update the driver with a FREE version. Firstly, click the**Update** button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver. Then you can manually install it.  
 Or you can click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
