### Option 1: Update your Microsoft drivers manually

**WARNING**  : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. And unless you know the exactly model of the hardware in need of a driver update & the variant of your Windows Operating System, it can present certain levels of difficulty.

So here’re we go:

1. Go to the manufacturer’s official website.
2. Check out the **Support**   section for **driver downloads** , then type in**the model of the hardware piece** you want a driver update with and search.
3. Among the driver releases, make sure to**ONLY** choose drivers that are both most up-to-date and compatible with **your variant of Windows Operating System** .
4. Double-click on the downloaded file and run the wizard to finish the install step by step.
5. **Restart** your computer for the changes to take effect.
