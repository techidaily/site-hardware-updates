 **Seeing a yellow warning icon next to RNDIS in Device Manager?** Don’t worry… Although it’s incredibly frustrating, you’re definitely not the only person to experience this problem. Many Windows users have reported the very same issue. More importantly, you should be able to fix it pretty easily…

## What is RNDIS?

 **RNDIS is short for “Remote Network Driver Interface Specification”** . It is a Microsoft proprietary protocol, which is often used on top of USB. As a protocol, RNDIS provides a virtual Ethernet link to most versions of the Windows, Linux,**Android** and FreeBSD operating systems.

 If a yellow warning icon appears next to it, it indicates that Windows has identified a problem with it. In most cases, this issue can be fixed after you reinstall or update its driver.

### **There are two methods to update RNDIS driver:**

 You can do it manually or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
