##  How to Watch Galaxy Unpacked 2022

 You can watch the event on [Samsung's website](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fglobal%2Fgalaxy%2Fevents%2Funpacked%2F) or [YouTube](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU206981/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpTBm%5Ffg-Wk) (or both at the same time if you really love Samsung devices).

 If you're a [VR](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-easing-high-encoding-issues-in-obs-for-2024/) user, you can watch the event through the [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) platform and get a 3D view of everything Samsung is set to announce. You'll hang out in a virtual representation of Samsung's New York store. It sounds like an odd way to watch a press event but to each their own.

##  What to Expect from Galaxy Unpacked 2022

 As is always the case with these significant events, there are enough rumors and leaks leading up to it for us to confidently say that Samsung will probably announce the Galaxy S22 series of phones.

 Some of the notable [rumors](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-galaxy-s22-rumors/) about the Galaxy S22 claim it'll come in three models. There should be a Galaxy S22, Galaxy S22 Plus, and a Galaxy S22 Ultra. The Ultra is [rumored](https://www.reviewgeek.com/102380/samsung-galaxy-s22/) to have a beefy 6.8-inch display, an integrated S Pen slot, and 45-watt charging. Again, these are rumors and leaks, so Samsung could do something else, but those specs do fall in line with what we'd expect to see.

 Presumably, Samsung will also have something else to announce outside of the phone. Some [leaks](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/26/22902649/samsung-galaxy-s22-unpacked-event-tab-s8-home-mini-2-date) suggest a new Tab S8 Android tablet will be announced, but we'll have to wait until February 9, 2022, at 10 AM ET, to find out for sure.
