## Samsung Galaxy Book #4 Edge: Enjoy Stunning Visuals on Its AMOLED Panel and Seamless Performance From the Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU.

Microsoft and Qualcomm are ready to roll out a new generation of powerful ARM-powered Windows laptops, and PC makers are along for the ride. Samsung has now revealed the Galaxy Book 4 Edge laptop with a Snapdragon X Elite chipset and AI features.

 The [Galaxy Book 4 Edge](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fgalaxy-books%2Fgalaxy-book4-edge%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-book4-edge-14-qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-512gb-sapphire-blue-np940xma-kb1us%2F) is one of several computers in the first wave of “[Copilot+ PCs](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-my-spouse-from-spying-on-my-motorola-moto-g24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/),” meaning it has the hardware required for [AI-powered ‘Recall’ search](https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/leveraging-chatgpt-for-effective-meditation-routines-a-step-by-step-guide/), Live Captions with real-time translation, more Windows Studio Effects, and other tasks that use on-device large language models (LLMs). It has an AMOLED 3K (2880x1800) 120Hz touch screen, available in either 14-inch or 16-inch sizes.

 The laptop uses the same ARM-based Snapdragon X Elite chip as Microsoft’s new [Surface Pro](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/enhancing-stories-through-animations-with-movie-maker/) and [Surface Laptop](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-samsung-lock-screen-clock-in-seconds-by-drfone-android/), as well as [Lenovo’s updated Yoga Slim 7x and ThinkPad T14s Gen 6](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-social-media-showdown-twitters-toptiktok-selection/). That’s supposed to offer performance comparable to high-end laptop processors from Intel, AMD, and Apple, but we haven’t seen much independent testing yet. You also get Wi-Fi 7 support, 16GB RAM, a 1080p front-facing camera, and either 512GB or 1TB storage.

Samsung

 Samsung also managed to include a decent port selection on the Galaxy Book 4 Edge. The 14-inch model has two USB 4.0 Type-C ports, an HDMI 2.1 connector with support for 4K at 60Hz, and a headphone/microphone combo jack. The larger 16-inch model adds another USB 3.2 port and a microSD card slot.

 Samsung said in a blog post, “Samsung collaborated with Microsoft to bring Copilot in Windows to Galaxy Book, enabling the perfect mix of on-device and cloud-based AI for the best experience. For everyday actions such as setting alarms, retrieving contacts, sending messages, and more, users can access their mobile devices via Copilot voice prompts. Copilot also supports intelligent, next-step action suggestions for increased productivity.”

 Qualcomm’s new chips are supposed to offer great performance with excellent battery life, but Samsung didn’t mention any battery life estimates on the Galaxy Book 4 Edge (not that PC manufacturers are honest with those claims, anyway). The total capacity on the 14-inch version is 55.9 Wh, while the 16-inch model has a slightly bigger 61.8 Wh battery.
