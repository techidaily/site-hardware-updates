##  A Brief History of Google Discover

 Google Discover's origins go back to 2012 when it was called "Google Now." The idea of "Google Now" was to give you information throughout the day without your input. In other words, Google would do the Google Searches for you.

 Google Now could show you boarding passes, upcoming sporting events, calendar events, tracking numbers, and much more. Slowly, Google stripped down the product and moved many of these features to Google Assistant's "[Snapshot](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/024-approved-flexibility-in-viewing-with-youtube-tv-options/)."

 Eventually, it was trimmed down to mostly articles from around the web, and it became referred to simply as the "[Google Feed](https://www.blog.google/products/search/feed-your-need-know/)." In 2018, Google officially [announced](https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-google-discover/) a new name and look for it, and that's the Google Discover we have today.

##  What Is Google Discover for?

![Google Discover.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screenshot_2023-12-11-17-00-29-62_680d03679600f7af0b4c700c6b270fe7.jpg) 

 The purpose of Google Discover is given away by its name. It's intended to help you discover content from around the web that pertains to your interests. Everyone's Google Discover feed is personalized to their preferences.

 You don't have to visit a rotation of websites or curate your own RSS feeds. Google does the work for you, gathering stories from around the web that it thinks you'll be interested in. All you have to do is open the Google app, and you have a smorgasbord of content to enjoy.

 Speaking of the app, as of this writing, Google Discover is a mobile experience only. You can use it on an iPhone, iPad, or Android phone or tablet. It's not available on the Google mobile site, either. Only the Google app available in the [Google Play Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU210138/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox) and [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942) has it.

##  How Does Google Discover Know What I Like?

 Google Discover is personalized for you, but how exactly does that work? First and foremost, Google is tapping into the information you have already given it. That can include web activity, YouTube history, Search queries, and more.

 More important than all of that, though, is how you personalize Discover. Think of the Discover feed as an algorithm. It's only as good as the information it has, so the more you help it along, the better it gets.

 At first, you may find stuff that you don't care about. Just because you searched one time for a Detroit Pistons score doesn't mean that you're a superfan who needs to know everything about the team. If you tell Google that you're not interested in that, it will get better.

##  How to View It on Your Phone

 It's easy to view the Google Discover feed on your [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942?at=1010l392g) or [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU210138/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox) device. First, simply open the Google app. On iPhone, the Discover feed is right under the search bar on the "Home" tab. On Android, you can go to the "Discover" tab.

 That's all there is to it, but to get the most out of the Discover feed, you'll want to personalize it to your interests.

##  How to Personalize Google Discover

 Personalizing Google Discover is all about taking action on content as you see it. Stories are presented in the feed as cards, and these cards include controls for fine-tuning. Tap the heart icon to like a story and see more like it, or tap the menu icon for more options.

 Tapping the menu button brings up a few options. I can either tell Google that I'm not interested in the story or topic, block content from the source, or manage my interests.

 That's the basics of personalizing the Discover feed, but there's even more that you can do with it. We've created guides for using Discover on an [iPhone](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-capturing-adventure-top-5-methods-for-screening-minecraft-on-apple-machines/) or [iPad](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-capturing-adventure-top-5-methods-for-screening-minecraft-on-apple-machines/) as well as on [Android](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/become-a-biography-guru-top-tips-for-standout-bios-on-facebook-for-2024/) devices.
