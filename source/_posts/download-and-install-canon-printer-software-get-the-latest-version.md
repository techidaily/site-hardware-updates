## Option 1 – Update the driver manually

 Lenovo keeps updating their Thinkpad X230 drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **[Lenovo Support](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcsupport.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Flaptops-and-netbooks%2Fthinkpad-x-series-laptops%2Fthinkpad-x230%2Fdownloads)**  website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 7 of 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 As Thinkpad X230 has various drivers for its different components such as the wireless network adapter, fingerprint reader and keyboard, you’ll have to download their drivers one by one, which is a bit time-consuming. To update the Lenovo X230 drivers, you may take the following steps:

1. Find your own way to the Lenovo Support website of Thinkpad X230\. Or you can simply **[click here](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcsupport.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Flaptops-and-netbooks%2Fthinkpad-x-series-laptops%2Fthinkpad-x230%2Fdownloads)**  .
