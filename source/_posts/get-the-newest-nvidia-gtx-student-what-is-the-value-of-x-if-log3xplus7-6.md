## How to update Actis 5 drivers

 Actually, you don’t have to install the specific driver to make SteelSeries Arctis 5 work or be recognized successfully. It comes with a plug-and-play feature.

 All you need to have is the generic USB audio driver and the onboard sound driver. Here’s how to do it:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/steelseries-arctis-5-drivers/#method2)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

2. Expand the**Sound, video and game controllers** . Then right-click the related devices, and select**Update driver** .
3. Click**Search automatically for drivers** .
4. Windows will start searching for the latest drivers and install them for you.

**Note:** Windows Device Manager doesn’t always detect outdated drivers. Nor does it always give you the latest available version if you update a driver. ([**Learn why…**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) )

 If Windows Device Manager fails to find a new driver for you, you need to source the driver directly from the device manufacturer or use a tool like ours, called **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , to do it automatically.

### Option 2: Automatically update all your device drivers

 One of the most common causes of sound issues is an outdated or faulty sound driver. Your SteelSeries Artis 5 is no exception.

 If you find the manual updating process tedious and time-consuming, you can do it update all your drivers with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It always gives you the latest available driver.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scan-now-1.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to your sound device or your Arctis 5 to download the latest and correct driver for it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audio-drivers.jpg)  
 Or you can also click the**Update All** button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will have full tech support and a 30-day money-back guarantee.)
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.

## Still have audio issues?

 In rare cases, updating your drivers won’t get your problem solved. If unfortunately, updating the SteelSeries Actis 5 drivers didn’t help, you can try the following troubleshooting steps:

### Set your Arctis 5 as the default

 Make sure you have set your SteelSeries Arctis 5 as the default output/input device. Also, select**Set as Default Communications** **Device** .

<a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Make sure you’ve set it up correctly

 Follow[**SteelSeries Actis 5 setup guide**](https://support.steelseries.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000022031-Setup-Arctis-5) to make sure you’ve done it right. Using the rear ports directly on your motherboard instead of any HUB ports or external hubs will ensure your drivers load correctly, and that the device receives adequate power.

### Have the latest version of SteelSeries Engine installed

 In-app updates are supported so you will be prompted to update directly through the Engine. But if this doesn’t do the trick, you can uninstall the SteelSeries Engine, and download[**the latest SteelSeries Engine**](https://steelseries.com/engine) .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Disable audio enhancements

1. In the bottom right corner, right-click the Volume icon, and select**Sounds** .
2. Under the**Playback** tab, right-click your headphone, and select**Properties** .
3. Switch to the**Enhancements** tab, check the**Disable all enhancements** option, and click**OK** to apply.

### Select different formats

 If you’re still unable to get anything, try selecting a different input/output format in the**Properties** \>**Advanced** window (use the headset steps above).
