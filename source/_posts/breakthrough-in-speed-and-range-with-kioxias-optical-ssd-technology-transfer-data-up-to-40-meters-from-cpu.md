 Samsung achieves its 4TB capacity using a 236-layer TLC V-NAND and uses a single-sided design, making it ideal for use in smaller setups - especially laptops of PlayStation 5 consoles where space is a premium.

 When we tested the Samsung 990 Pro 4TB, we found it dominating the competition on almost every test. For example, on 3DMark's storage test, it had the lowest latency, which is great for gaming.

 The Samsung 990 Pro is also excellent at sustaining strong write performance. If you're writing continuously for several minutes on most drives, you'll notice a huge performance drop as the the data fills up the high-speed cache and ends up using the slower TLC NAND Flash. We test sustained write speeds using Iometer for 15 minutes.

 In our tests, the 4TB 990 Pro was able to maintain a speed of 6.2 GB/s for 75 seconds thanks to its generous 10GB of pSLC cache. Once the data spills over into the TLC, it operates at a -- strong, compared to most drives -- 1.6 GB/s.

 The Samsung 990 Pro is also a leader in power efficiency, delivering 421.1 MB/s per watt. That number puts it ahead of all competitors but the Addlink A93 4TB and Lxar NM790 4TB.
