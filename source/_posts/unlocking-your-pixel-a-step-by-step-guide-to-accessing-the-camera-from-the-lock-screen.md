## Unlocking Your Pixel: A Step-by-Step Guide to Accessing the Camera From the Lock Screen

In 2021, Android 12 added many new features to Google Pixel devices, but it also took some away. The camera shortcut that has long been present on the lock screen was removed. So, how do you quickly open the Camera?

 Thankfully, Android devices feature a few different methods for [quickly launching the camera](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/effective-techniques-to-restore-audio-functionality-in-conexant-smartaudio-hd-devices-compatible-with-windows/). Google Pixel devices are no different. The lock screen shortcut was handy, but it's actually not the fastest method. There's something even better.

 A quick recap: Google Pixel devices since Android 12 come with two shortcuts on the lock screenâ€”smart home device controls and [Google Wallet](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-innovative-techniques-for-secure-and-quality-vimeo-recording/). Previously, those two shortcuts were for the phone and the camera.

 To launch the camera without the lock screen shortcut, simply double-press the power button. The camera will immediately open.

 This works from anywhere. That includes the lock screen and when the display isn't even on. Just double-press the power button, and the camera will launch. Easy peasy.

 This doesn't bypass the security on your lock screen. It only opens the camera. You'll need to properly unlock your Pixel phone to leave the camera.

 Unfortunately, unlike Samsung Galaxy phones, Google does not allow you to customize the shortcuts on the lock screen. You can choose to show or hide the smart home device controls and Google Wallet shortcuts, but you can't change them. Go to Settings > Display > Lock Screen if you'd like to take a look.

 Boom. No more worrying about [missing a moment](https://win-dash.techidaily.com/complete-guide-free-driver-software-for-optimal-functionality-of-your-hp-designjet-500/) because you couldn't get your camera out fast enough. It's a little strange that Google would remove this shortcut, but it does make sense with the ability to launch the camera with the power button.
