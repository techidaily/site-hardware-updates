 "APK" is an extremely common term in the Android world, and it's an even more important part of the Android operating system. We'll share some information about APK files, show you how to install them on your Android device, and how to check if they're safe to download.

##  What Is an APK File, and What Is It Used For?

 APK, short for "Android Package Kit" and sometimes referred to as "Android Application Package," is the file format used for applications on Android devices. An APK file is a specialized ZIP file containing all the necessary data for installing an app on an Android device, including its code, assets, and resources. Think of it like an EXE file on Windows.

 Until August 2021, APK was the standard format for publishing and distributing Android apps on the Google Play Store. After that, Google introduced the [AAB (Android App Bundle) format](https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-the-artisans-guide-to-tiktok-captions-top-5-craftsmanship-strategies-for-2024/), which delegates the process of APK generation. AABs are now the required format for developers to upload their apps to the Play Store. Then, how are APKs still useful?

 AABs didn't replace APKs. In fact, the app bundle _creates_ an APK specifically for your device. APKs also make it easy to install apps from sources other than the Play Store. They allow you to download updates that haven't yet been released on the Play Store, install older versions of apps, and install delisted apps or apps that haven't been approved for the Play Store.

##  Are APK Files Legal and Safe to Download?

 Developers must adhere to Google Play Developer Program Policies and Developer Distribution Agreements to publish their apps on the Google Play Store. Additionally, [Google uses Play Protect](https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/king-video-dominance-hashtag-hacks-exposed-for-2024/), which conducts safety checks before downloading apps. So, apps installed from the Google Play Store are generally safe.

 However, when you manually install an app using an APK file, you bypass safety protocols and may unknowingly install a malicious file. To prevent potential infection, always download APK files from the official developer's website. If you opt for another source, ensure it is trustworthy. Also, you can [use tools like VirusTotal to confirm the file is safe](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/pinnacle-tools-for-subs-to-srt-unveiling-the-top-8-win-and-mac-software-for-2024/) before downloading it.

 Downloading APKs is considered legal only when sourced from the official website. Using a third-party website, which may have altered the APK file to access premium features, violates copyright laws. Moreover, downloading pirated or cracked copies of apps without the developer's consent is highly unethical.

##  Can You Install an APK on an iPhone, iPad, or macOS?

 While Android uses APK files for installing applications, iOS relies on a different format called IPA (iOS App Store Package). So, APK files are incompatible with iOS or iPadOS and cannot be opened on these platforms. Likewise, macOS does not inherently support APK files, although you can still use emulators to run them, bearing in mind the potential risks involved.

 Now that you clearly understand APKs, you should be able to install them on your Android device confidently. [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/) and [APKPure](https://apkpure.com/) are reliable sources hosting safe-to-install APK files. If you're unable to find an APK file on the official source, you can use these two websites to download it.
