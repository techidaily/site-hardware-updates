 See our[review of the MSI Katana 15](https://tools.techidaily.com) for more details and thoughts on this Editor's Choice award-winning product. We awarded the 2023 variant of the Katana 15 4.5 stars and praised its strong 1080p gaming performance, good speakers, and excellent value. The negatives were a slightly shorter battery life than we would have ideally desired, a slightly washed-out display, and a garishly designed keyboard.
