##  Make a Samsung Phone Display the Battery Percentage

 On a Samsung phone running Android 11 or 12, first, launch the Settings app. Then, navigate to Notifications > Advanced Settings.

![Tap &quot;Advanced Settings.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/5-samsung-android-advanced-settings.png) 

 If you're on Android 10 (learn [how to check your Android version](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-sound-issues-in-windows-solutions-for-audio-pop-ups/)), you'll head into Settings > Notifications > Status Bar.

 Then, toggle on the "Show Battery Percentage" option.

![Turn on "Show Battery Percentage."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/6-samsung-android-show-battery-percentage.png) 

 You now have your [current battery levels](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-comparative-analysis-64-vs-128gb-video-holding-power/) shown in your screen's top-right corner. To hide it again, turn off the "Show Battery Percentage" option.

##  Show the Battery Percentage on a Pixel Phone

 If you use a Pixel phone, then first, launch the Settings app on your phone. In Settings, tap "Battery."

##  Make Other Android Phones Always Show Battery Percentage

 If you don't have a Samsung or Pixel device and you're having trouble finding the toggle, you can try this set of instructions instead. We're using a OnePlus Nord phone here, but again, the steps will likely vary slightly for your device.

 Start by launching Settings on your Android phone. In Settings, select "Display."

![Tap "Display" in Settings.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1-android-display-settings.png) 

 Scroll down the "Display" page and select "Status Bar." You'll customize the status bar (the bar at the top of your phone's screen) so it displays the battery option.

![Choose "Status Bar."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2-android-customize-status-bar.png) 

 On the "Status Bar" page, turn on the "Show Battery Percentage" option.

 To hide the battery percentage in the future, toggle off the "Show Battery Percentage" option.

![Enable "Show Battery Percentage."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3-android-show-battery-percentage.png) 

 And that's it. Your phone now displays the current battery levels in the screen's top-right corner.

![Battery percentage in the status bar on an Android phone.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/4-android-battery-percentage.png) 

 And that's all there is to adding (and removing) the battery percentage option on your Android phone's status bar. Very useful!
