## Do I need drivers for Audio Technica?

 Audio Technica offers a plug-and-play feature by allowing your operating system to recognize your product via a USB audio driver.

 This means that there’s no specific driver for your USB microphones or turntables, so it doesn’t need an additional driver installation. But if your device fails to be detected, or it’s not working properly, you can update the USB audio driver.

## How to update to the latest driver?

 There are two ways you can update your USB Audio CODEC (Audio Technica) driver:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/audio-technica-drivers-update/#method2)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Manually

 To update your USB-Serial Controller D driver manually, you’ll need to go to Device Manager to update the driver automatically. If Windows fails to find any updates ([lear](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [n](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [why…](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), then head to the manufacturer’s official website to download the exact driver for your device and install it manually.

1. Open Device Manager.  
   * For Windows 10: Right-click the**Start** menu, and select**Device Manager** .
