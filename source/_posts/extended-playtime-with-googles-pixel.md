 Google held its [event today](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-country-on-app-store-for-iphone-11-pro-max-with-7-methods-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) to announce the next-generation Pixel phones. The company revealed the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, and both phones come with solid specs and shockingly low price tags.

##  Google Pixel 6

 The Pixel 6 comes with a solid 6.4" screen with a 1080x2400 resolution. It has a refresh rate of up to 90Hz. In addition, the screen supports Always-on technology with At a Glance and Now Playing, which lets you see essential information without unlocking your phone.

 Google touted the phone's battery life, claiming that it would last more than 30 hours on a single charge with its 4614 mAh battery. As you might expect from a flagship device, it features fast charging that will get you a 50% charge in about 30 minutes.

_Google_

 As was teased before the phones were officially announced, Google is using its own [Google Tensor](https://howto.techidaily.com/8-ultimate-fixes-for-google-play-your-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-isnt-compatible-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) silicon rather than relying on chips from Qualcomm or another company. The phone comes with 8GB LPDDR5 RAM and 128GB or 256GB storage, depending on which model you go with.

 As this is a Pixel phone, it comes with a tremendous camera system, including a 50MP Octa PD Quad Bayer wide camera with a ƒ/1.85 aperture and a 12MP ultrawide camera with a ƒ/2.2 aperture. The front camera is an 8MP sensor with an ƒ/2.0 aperture. You can use the rear camera to record up to 4K resolution at 30 FPS or 60 FPS.

 The phone comes with full support for 5G, so you'll get the fastest data speeds if you have it available where you live.

##  Pixel 6 Pro

 Google also announced a Pixel 6 Pro, which features some substantial upgrades over the more affordable Pixel 6 model. It bumps up the screen size to 6.7" and brings the refresh rate to 120Hz. The resolution also gets a bump to 1440 x 3120.

 The battery is a little bigger, which makes sense since the phone itself is larger. It's 5003mAh and promises more than 24 hours of life on a single charge (though it could get over 30 hours in the right situations).

 The Pixel 6 Pro comes with 12GB LPDDR5 RAM and [Google's Tensor processor](https://howto.techidaily.com/8-ultimate-fixes-for-google-play-your-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-isnt-compatible-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/).

 Two of the lenses on the camera system are the same, but the Pro adds a 48 MP telephoto camera with an ƒ/3.5 aperture. Google also bumped up the selfie camera for the Pro, making it 11.1MP. That gives the front camera the ability to record 4K video at 30 FPS, while the front camera of the regular Pixel 6 only records in 1080p.

 Google made some smart upgrades to the Pro that make it worthwhile. The company makes a compelling case for upgrading to the higher-end phone between the better camera system, additional RAM, and better screen.

 Both devices come with lots of new features that [Google teased when it first revealed the phones](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-pokemons-for-pvp-matches-in-pokemon-go-for-oppo-reno-10-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) including impressive security, the Magic Eraser, and lots more.

##  New Pixel 6 Price and Availability

 Google definitely put some solid specs in the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, but the really attractive thing about them is the price. The base model starts at only $599, and the Pixel 6 Pro starts at $899, both of which are quite a bit cheaper than most other flagship phones on the market.

 The phone is set to ship on October 28, 2021, which means we won't have to wait long to get our hands on the devices.
