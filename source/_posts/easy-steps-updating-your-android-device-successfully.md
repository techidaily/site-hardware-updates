##  Update an Android Phone or Tablet

 Since Android devices from different manufacturers use different option names, your device might display a different setting name than what we've mentioned in the steps below. However, you'll get a general idea as to what option to tap on your device.

 To [find your current Android version](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-sound-issues-in-windows-solutions-for-audio-pop-ups/), check out our guide on that topic.

 To start the process, launch Settings on your Android phone or tablet. Scroll down in Settings and choose "System."

![Select "System" in Settings.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1-android-system-settings.png) 

 On the "System" page, select "System Updates."

![Choose "System Updates."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2-android-system-updates.png) 

 Your device will automatically start looking for the latest updates. If an update is available, you'll see it on your screen.

 All Android devices eventually stop receiving updates. If yours has passed its [update support period](https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/how-to-delete-icloud-account-with-or-without-password-from-your-iphone-se-2022windowsmac-by-drfone-ios/), that means it's time to [replace your Android phone](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/hot-takes-highlight-twitters-trending-topics-for-2024/) or [tablet](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/16757146-updated-bite-sized-video-knowledge-now/).

 Tap the "Download & Install Now" button to get the update and install it on your device.

![Select "Download & Install Now."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/3-android-download-install-updates.png) 

 Wait for your phone or tablet to download the update. When that's done, your device will automatically install it. This can take a while so be patient. Then, your device will reboot, bringing the changes into effect.

 You're now running the most recent version of Android for your particular device. Enjoy!
