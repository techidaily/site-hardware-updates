 Everyone has a window to the internet in their pocket, but that's not always a good thing. You may be concerned about how much time you spend on your phone. Thankfully, Android devices include a handy tool to let you keep tabs on your screen time.

 Android devices—including Samsung Galaxy phones—have a suite of tools called "Digital Wellbeing." It's your one-stop shop for seeing detailed breakdowns of how you use your phone. You can see [which apps you use the most](https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/2024-approved-starting-with-social-giving-best-practices-for-fb-posts/) and how long you're staring at the screen, which is what we'll be showing here.

 The steps below are for Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel devices, but Digital Wellbeing is available on most Android devices. Look for similarly named settings on your device.

##  How to Check Screen Time on a Samsung Galaxy Phone

 On a Samsung Galaxy phone, first swipe down once from the top of the screen to reveal the Quick Settings. Tap the gear icon.

 The circle chart at the top shows your screen time for the current day. App usage is illustrated in colors around the circle. To see more information, tap the center of the circle.

 If this is your first time opening Digital Wellbeing, you might have to tap "Show Info" to see your stats.
