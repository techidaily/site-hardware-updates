 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

**1)** Find your Gigabyte motherboard model name.

 You might be confused: you’re looking for an audio driver, not the motherboard. It’s because all motherboards on the market come with embedded sound cards or onboard audio.  
 Therefore, if you want to download your Gigabyte audio driver, you must find its motherboard information.

**2)** Go to the[Gigabyte official website](https://www.gigabyte.com/us) and look for the Gigabyte motherboard model you have.

**3)** Click**Support** , and select your operating system to find the correct driver.
