 The MSI Bravo 15 uses a cooling design that uses 6 copper cooling pipes that are shared between both the CPU and GPU to help keep the system as cool as possible when in use. Once the heat is picked up by the pipes, 2 fans work to blow that heat outside of the laptop.

 There's also plenty of connectivity with 1 x HDMI 2.0 port, 1 x USB Type-C (DP) port, 2 x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, and 1 x USB 2.0 Type-A port. If you want to connect a headset or speaker via a cable connection there's also a headphone/microphone combo jack.
