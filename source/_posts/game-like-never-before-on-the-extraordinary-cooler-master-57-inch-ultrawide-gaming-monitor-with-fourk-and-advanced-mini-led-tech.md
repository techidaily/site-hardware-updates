 With a monitor this low in price you're limited to only a couple of video input options, that include just the one HDMI port and a singular DisplayPort input. However, this monitor also features built-in speakers and a 3.5mm audio jack for extra audio options should you need them, which is always a bonus if you don't have the space for a small speaker setup or fancy streaming some media and don't want to wear a headset.
