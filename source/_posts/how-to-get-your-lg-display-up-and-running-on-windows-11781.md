## 2 ways to get the latest Bluetooth driver

[Option 1: Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – This requires some computer knowledge. You need to visit the manufacturer’s website, search for your model, then download and install the Bluetooth driver step by step.

**[Option 2: Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-zexmte-bluetooth-adapter-driver-windows-10-8-7/#option2)**  – One of the easiest ways to get the latest Bluetooth driver. All it takes will be just a few clicks.

### Option 1: Install Bluetooth drivers manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can try to install/update your Zexmte adapter driver manually. If you don’t know how, just do the following:

#### Windows 10 or 8

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) to invoke the Run dialog. Type or paste**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

2. Click**Bluetooth** to expand the category. Right-click your Bluetooth adapter and select**Update driver** .

#### Windows 7

1. Insert the CD that comes with the package and open the directory on your PC.
2. Double-click**Setup** to open the installer. Then follow the on-screen instructions to proceed.

### Option 2: Automatically update Zexmte Bluetooth drivers (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the Bluetooth driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro version** of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system  

 (This requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
