 The Logitech Driving Force GT Driver is a program that makes your computer and your racing wheel attached work together.

 If you want to set up the Logitech Driving Force Racing Steering Wheel on your PC, you’ll need to install the correct driver for it.

 Or, if you’ve install the driver for your device, yet somehow your gaming steering wheel won’t work, try updating its driver. This is because gaming wheel issues often occur when you’re using a faulty or outdated driver.

There are 2 ways you can get the correct driver safely and easily:

### Option 1: Manual update the Logitech Driving Force GT driver

 If you wish to update your driver manually, follow the instructions below:

**1)** Go to **[Logitech official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , then click**SUPPORT > Downloads** .

**2)** Type**driving force gt** on the search box, then click**Driving Force GT** .

**4)** Find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit), and download the driver manually.

**5)** Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2: Automatically update the Logitech Driving Force GT driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
