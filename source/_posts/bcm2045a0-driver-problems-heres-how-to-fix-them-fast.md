### Method 1: Update your USB driver manually

To update your USB driver, you should get your USB driver update from the Lenovo’s official website, then install it on your own. **1)**Go to the **[Lenovo official website](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww3.lenovo.com%2F)**  and search your computer model.

**2)** Go to the driver download page of your product, then download the correct and latest USB drivers to your computer.

 Download the driver that’s suitable for your variant of Windows system. You should know what system is running on your computer — whether it’s Windows 7, 8 or 10, 32-bit or 64-bit version, etc.

**3)**Open the downloaded driver and follow the on-screen instructions to install them on your computer.
