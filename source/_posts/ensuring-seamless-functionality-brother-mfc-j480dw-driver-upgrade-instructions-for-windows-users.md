![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mfcj650dw_us_eu_as.jpg)

Keeping your **Brother scanner**driver up to date can help your scanner works properly. So you should regularly check your scanner driver and make sure it’s updated

## To update your Brother scanner driver

There are two ways you can update your Brother scanner driver:[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)– You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/brother-scanner-drivers-update-for-windows/#b)– This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

Brother keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **[Brother website](https://support.brother.com)** , find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
