The Void RGB Elite has been available since 2019 and In our[Corsair Void RGB Elite review](https://tools.techidaily.com) we noted its sleek design with a carbon finish, a clear microphone that "you could land planes with.", and a breathable fit thanks to the microfibre mesh fabric with very soft foam padding in the earpads.

 These cans are also capable of 7.1 surround when connected to a PC and using Corsair's iCUE software. Unfortunately, the 7.1 surround sound is not available when connected to the PlayStation 5 console. When gaming or using Discord you can easily mute your voice thanks to a flip-up mute function and a built-in LED mute indicator to let you know when you're broadcasting.
