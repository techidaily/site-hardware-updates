 Nvidia's graphics cards — both the new RTX 4090/4080 and the previous generation RTX 30-series — often tend to be overpriced. We've axed the 30-series, as those cards have been displaced by the newer, better, and often cheaper 40-series parts. The[RTX 4070](https://tools.techidaily.com) for instance trades blows with the RTX 3080 10GB, costs at least $100 less, and uses 30% less power; it also supports DLSS 3 Frame Generation and some other new features. Similar arguments can be made for the RTX 4060 Ti against the RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 4070 Ti against the RTX 3090, or the RTX 4080 and 4090 against any previous generation part.

 AMD often offers more value for your money, and it has some excellent deals in the budget to midrange bracket. All of AMD's GPUs are selling below their original MSRPs these days, which they should be considering some of the GPUs have been out for a while now. Of course, some of those MSRPs were inflated thanks to the price rises from the GPU shortages of the past.

 Like Nvidia, there aren't really many official "deals" as such on Intel's Arc GPUs. At least the Arc A770, A750, and A380 are all available for purchase, including the ASRock A770 8GB. MSRPs also dropped on some of those (the A750 and A770 8GB) to make the parts more competitive.  
  
 Performance from Arc GPUs continues to improve, with the A750 and A770 generally beating Nvidia's RTX 3060\. They cost less than the Nvidia card as well, and (usually) deliver superior ray tracing performance compared to AMD's GPUs. But with rasterization performance roughly matching the RX 6650 XT, the Arc 700-series at best looks like a tie with the 6000-series generation AMD competition.

 The Nvidia RTX 4090 is the best GPU money can buy and reigns supreme over any other GPU offering from any other manufacturer. If you want the most powerful graphics card in your gaming rig or productivity system then it HAS to be an RTX 4090.

 With 16384 CUDA cores, a massive 24GB of super-fast GDDR6X VRAM on a 384-bit bus putting out 21 Gbps, the RTX 4090 is unmatched. The core clock of this card is 2520 MHz before any boosting.  
  
 See our[review of Nvidia's RTX 4090](https://tools.techidaily.com) for more benchmarking and performance information.

### What to Look for in a Graphics Card Deal

When shopping for a graphics card, consider the following.

 🔎**What resolution, settings do you want to play at?** A low-end budget graphics card can play games at 1080p in medium settings, but if you want to play at ultra settings, you'll need to get at least a mid-range card. As you move up the stack of cards, you can play at 2K resolution and higher settings or, with the priciest cards, 4K.

 🔎**How many fps do you consider smooth?** Most people consider 30 fps the bare minimum for playability and 60 fps decent. However, if you want less lag for eSports gaming, you'll want to be able to go to over 100 fps at reasonable settings. See our[GPU benchmark hierarchy](https://tools.techidaily.com) to find out how each GPU fares.

 🔎**Do you have enough power?** Make sure that you have enough capacity from your power supply to support the card. If you're not sure, use a tool such as[Newegg's power supply calculator](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3Dtomshardware-us-8882668544987676394%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Ftools%252Fpower-supply-calculator%252F) to see how much you need. If your power supply can't handle the card, either get a new PSU or a different card.

 🔎**Will it fit in your case?** If you've got a small PC case, make sure you check the length of the card against the case's clearance numbers.
