 Being a digital nomad has its challenges. We need to protect our devices from hacking, keep our screen content private from onlookers, ensure our devices stay charged, block out noise during calls, and more. Fortunately, there are tech gadgets tailored to meet these needs that you should definitely know about.

## 1  Privacy Screen Protectors 

![A product image of a privacy screen protector.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-product-image-of-a-privacy-screen-protector.png) 

[SightPro](https://www.sightpro.com/products/sightpro-14-1-inch-4-3-privacy-screen-filter-for-laptops)

 A Privacy Screen Protector is a screen filter that attaches to the display of a laptop, tablet, or smartphone. It limits the viewing angle, so only the person directly in front of the screen can see the content clearly. Anyone looking from an angle sees an obscured screen. This prevents shoulder surfers and onlookers from glimpsing your confidential information.

 Because of this, a screen protector is the ideal gadget to maintain your privacy when working in public spaces. In addition to safeguarding your privacy, it reduces glare in bright environments and also acts as a regular screen protector, shielding your device from scratches, smudges, and other damage.

 You can find a [screen protector for your laptop,](https://www.amazon.com/SightPro-14-Inch-Anti-Glare-Protector/dp/B07LCXKFGV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003751&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-every-digital-nomad-should-know-about%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) [smartphone](https://www.amazon.com/UltraGlass-14-Pro-Max-Protector/dp/B0CTCB7K3P?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003751&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-every-digital-nomad-should-know-about%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), or [tablet devices](https://www.amazon.com/ProCase-Privacy-Protector-Anti-Spy-Tempered/dp/B09H6S5LDG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003751&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-every-digital-nomad-should-know-about%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) priced between $10 and $50.

 When traveling or working in public places, one of the biggest risks is having our phone or laptop hacked, leading to accidental data breaches and giving away sensitive information to hackers. If someone hacks into your smartphone, they can track your location. You can prevent this with a [Faraday bag](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/snapshot-stability-mastering-motion-for-2024/).

 A Faraday bag is designed to shield electronic devices from radio frequencies (RF) and electromagnetic fields. When you place your devices inside the bag, they cannot send or receive signals, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and cellular.

 You can find a Faraday bag for all your accessories, including your laptop, smartphone, tablet, and more, for under $30 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hodufy-Protector-Waterproof-Fireproof-Electronics/dp/B0CNYYMFNM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003751&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-every-digital-nomad-should-know-about%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen).

 If you travel to remote areas or spend most of your time outdoors and worry about your laptop or cell phone’s battery dying at crucial times, you should [get familiar with solar chargers](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-innovative-approaches-for-mosaic-photography/). These chargers convert solar energy into electrical energy, allowing you to power your devices with sunlight when conventional power sources are unavailable.

 Using solar chargers not only ensures your battery won’t drain out at crucial times but also reduces your environmental footprint by utilizing renewable energy sources for charging. These chargers typically feature foldable panels that are extremely lightweight, making them convenient to carry while traveling.

 On [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/FlexSolar-Portable-Waterproof-Foldable-Compatible/dp/B09H6GGK55?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003751&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-every-digital-nomad-should-know-about%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), solar chargers typically cost between $20 and $200, depending on capacity and features.

## 4  Foldable Laptop Stands 

![UPRYZE laptop stand](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/upryze_stand.jpg) 

_UPRYZE_

 The last thing you want when traveling is waking up with back, shoulder, or neck pain from prolonged working sessions in a bad posture. If you often struggle with these issues or find it challenging to work long hours due to a lack of tools for maintaining good posture, consider investing in a [foldable laptop stand](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/bandicam-or-camtasia-best-recording-and-editing-software-for-2024/).

 These stands allow you to adjust the height and angle of your laptop, elevating the screen to eye level. This helps you maintain a proper posture and work for extended periods without the risk of strain. A laptop stand also improves airflow around your device, preventing overheating and enhancing overall performance.

 Most laptop stands are foldable, lightweight, and easy to carry, ensuring they do not increase the weight of the luggage. You can find a decent-quality [laptop stand](https://www.amazon.com/Ergonomic-Adjustable-computer-Portable-MacBook/dp/B08G3YGDJ1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003751&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-every-digital-nomad-should-know-about%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) for under $50.

## 5  Noise Canceling Headphones With a Mic 

![noice cancelling headphones placed closed to a tree and grass.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/52517324205_343b5e837d_o.jpg)

 Working in noisy environments like cafés, co-working spaces, or airports can severely impact our focus and productivity. Likewise, participating in remote meetings, calls, or recording audio and video becomes challenging due to the surrounding noise, resulting in poor audio quality and difficulty in communication.

 If you face these issues, consider investing in an active noise-canceling headset with a built-in ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) mic. These headsets eliminate unwanted ambient sounds, ensuring clear audio input and output. Designed for extended wear, they prioritize comfort during prolonged use. Moreover, they are [available in various price ranges](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-a-itel-a60-phone-that-is-locked-by-drfone-android/), making it easier to find one that fits your budget.

## 6  Smart Luggage 

![Wheeled suitcase on a luggage belt at the airport terminal](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/luggage.jpg)

 Smart luggage is a revolutionary piece of gear that offers added convenience and security for your belongings. Equipped with built-in charging ports, it allows you to charge electronic devices on the move and features GPS tracking to locate misplaced luggage. These bags also boast electronic locks managed via smartphone apps.

 Besides that, smart luggage includes built-in weight measurement. Some models even notify you if your luggage is moved when out of sight. However, these [smart bags](https://www.amazon.com/TPRC-Luggage-Durable-Constructed-Millions/dp/B0762VC1XB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003751&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-every-digital-nomad-should-know-about%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) come with a higher initial cost, which may not fit into a tight budget. Additionally, some smart luggage bags are heavier than traditional ones, which could limit the amount of belongings you can carry.

## 7  Portable Projectors

 A pocket projector is a compact and portable device that can project visual displays onto surfaces like walls and screens. You can connect it to your smartphone, laptop, or media player, making it versatile for both work and leisure activities. Use it for presentations or transform your hotel room or outdoor space into a mini cinema for a movie night.

 These projectors are small and lightweight, yet they offer decent image quality, with some capable of HD or Full HD resolution. However, they may not provide the same level of visual experience as traditional projectors. Check out some of the [best portable projectors](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-a-tweet-to-snap-showcase-video-posting-techniques-for-2024/) you can buy right now.
