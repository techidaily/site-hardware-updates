##  What to Look for With VR Earbuds and Headphones

 Virtual reality is one of the most immersive forms of media. One of the best ways to improve the experience is with a good pair of earbuds, which shield you from ambient noise and let you roam your VR world without distractions. However, finding a good set of earbuds for VR isn't easy, and not all are up to the task.

 Sound quality and noise cancellation are two of the most important factors when shopping for VR earbuds. Noise cancellation is especially important if you use the headset in a busy household or other space with many disturbances. Sound quality is essential, and a good pair of earbuds will enhance your audio and help bring your games, software, and videos to life. Sticking to trusted brands like Sony, Razer, and Logitech is an easy suggestion, as they've built a reputation around designing earbuds with premium hardware.

 Aside from sound quality and noise cancellation, you might also want something with a crisp microphone. This isn't necessary for everyone, but if you dive into multiplayer games or chat with friends, it's good to have a reliable way to get your thoughts across without static.

 VR headsets come in all shapes and sizes, meaning you'll need to check that your prospective earbuds are compatible with your specific headset. Some earbuds are made specifically for VR, but even these may not play nicely with all the headsets available in today's market.

 With all that in mind, here are the five best earbuds for VR. Most of these work with various headsets, but they all provide impressive audio and good noise cancellation and span multiple budgets.

Soundcore

| Pros                         | Cons                    |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Great price                  | Unimpressive microphone |
| USB-C dongle for low latency |                         |
| Multiplatform support        |                         |
| Unique design                |                         |

 Soundcore might not be as well-known as Logitech or Razer, but the company's [VR P10 Gaming Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Earbuds-Low-Officially-Co-branded-Included-Compatible/dp/B0B87MQG2N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003261&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-earbuds-for-vr%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) are an excellent choice for virtual reality. They work best with the [Meta Quest 2](https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B099VMT8VZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003261&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-earbuds-for-vr%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), though it's likely they'll be compatible with other headsets that support Bluetooth or a USB-C dongle.

 The USB-C dongle is one of the big selling points, as it helps produce a lag-free environment capable of keeping up with even the fastest VR games. Soundcore says you'll get latency under 30ms, making it better than many earbuds available today. That also makes them great for other platforms, as you can use them with Steam Deck, PS5, PC, or Switch when you're not plugged into VR.

 The tiny earbuds' sound quality is excellent, thanks to 11mm drivers and a [BassUp](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.soundcore.com%2Fpages%2Fbassup) feature that produces booming explosions and brings soundtracks to life. Coupled with six hours of battery life on a single charge (up to 24 hours with the case), pass-through charging to keep your devices juiced up while gaming, and a sleek white design, the Soundcore VR P10 is the ideal companion for VR gaming.

 Keep in mind that you won't get touch controls or pass-through charging with the [Meta Quest 3](https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003261&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-earbuds-for-vr%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), but that's a minor quirk on an otherwise great device.

Logitech

| Pros                             | Cons                          |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Wired connection for reduced lag | Not as convenient as wireless |
| Multiple available colors        |                               |
| Great sound quality              |                               |

 If you don't want to deal with wireless connections, the [Logitech G333 Gaming Earphones](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G333-Gaming-Earphones-Oculus-Quest/dp/B0842ZG5P4?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003261&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-earbuds-for-vr%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) are a great alternative. They're a bit pricey for wired buds, but they're built to Logitech's high standards, ensuring you get a powerful audio experience for your investment.

 What makes these great for VR is their 3.5mm jack, which allows them to connect to most headsets and provides audio with virtually no lag. They're also built with dual drivers, one designed to hit highs and mids while the other is tuned to generate booming bass. That makes them great for everything from Beat Saber to Population: One, as they reproduce all kinds of sounds with shocking clarity.

 Because these are wired, you'll benefit from in-line controls for the microphone and volume. So, if you're not a fan of the touch controls on most wireless earbuds, you'll love the easy-access buttons on the G333.

 Rounding out the earbuds spec sheet is a durable aluminum housing, three earbud styles, and additional connectivity options thanks to a USB-C plug. Not everyone will love the wired connection type, but if it meshes with your playstyle, the G333 are hard to beat.

Razer

| Pros                         | Cons      |
| ---------------------------- | --------- |
| Works great with Meta Quest  | Expensive |
| USB-C dongle for low latency |           |
| Sleek design                 |           |

 The [Razer Hammerhead HyperSpeed Wireless](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL7NDPQB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003261&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-earbuds-for-vr%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) were explicitly designed for use with Meta Quest 2 and 3\. In fact, their charging case carries not just Razer branding but also a distinct "Made for Meta" tag. That makes them the best earbuds for Meta Quest—though they'll likely work with other VR headsets if you're looking for a premium audio experience.

 These earbuds use a USB-C dongle to produce low-latency audio, though you can also use Bluetooth to sync with smartphones or other electronics. Along with native support for the Meta Quest, these earbuds feature [active noise cancellation](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-sharing-twitch-on-your-fb-page-for-2024/), over six hours of battery life on a single charge (up to 26 hours with the case), and a snug bud design that stays in place whether you're sitting on the couch or moving around your room.

 Beyond a great audio experience, the Hammerhead HyperSpeed Wireless boasts an impressive microphone. The earbuds use dual environmental noise-cancelling (ENC) microphones to help eliminate ambient noise, ensuring your teammates hear you loud and clear.

 Like most Razer products, these VR earbuds are quite expensive. But if you have the budget for them, they'll make a great companion for your headset.

 Earbuds are great for VR because they're small and easily fit around your headset. But picking up a gaming headset isn't a bad idea if you want truly immersive sound. The [Logitech G Pro Gaming Headset](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Gaming-Headset-Oculus-Quest-PC/dp/B08DCSBD1P?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003261&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-earbuds-for-vr%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is particularly great for VR, as it's explicitly designed for Meta and should work well with other select VR headsets.

 Keep in mind that this is a bonafide headset, so it's much larger than any of the actual earbuds on this list. However, there aren't many earbuds (or headphones) designed specifically for VR, making the Logitech G Pro Headset a bit of a unicorn. Aside from easy operation with your Quest 2 (thanks to a short cable designed specifically for the headset), the G Pro includes booming 50mm drivers, plush leatherette ear cups, and a steel headband for added durability.

 Because the headset is large, you may not want to use it with VR games that require lots of movement, as it's more likely to store heat than tiny earbuds. There's also the possibility it'll shift during gaming if you're making rapid movements. But if you want to be truly immersed in your VR games, these should do an excellent job of blocking out ambient noise and churning out crisp audio.
