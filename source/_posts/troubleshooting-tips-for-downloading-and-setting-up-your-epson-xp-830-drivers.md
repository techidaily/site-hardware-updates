 As you decide to read this post, you must be looking for the Sandisk SSD drivers. However, the truth is, there’s no need to find such things because they don’t exist at all. A Sandisk SSD (Solid-State Drive) doesn’t need a driver to ensure its proper functioning. So when your computer cannot recognize an inserted Sandisk SSD, you should instead look to the motherboard manufacturers for drivers that correspond with your**motherboard SATA Controllers** , a hardware interface connecting SSDs to motherboards.

## How to find out my motherboard model

 To download the motherboard SATA Controller drivers, you should first find out what your motherboard model is. If you’ve already known the exact model, simple skip this section and head to the next one; otherwise please follow the steps below to look for relevant information.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then, type in**msinfo32** and click**OK** .

2. Here pops up the**System Information** window. On the**System Summary** tab, in the details pane, look for**System Manufacturer** and**System Model** , then take note of their**Value** – that’s precisely the make and model of your motherboard.  
 For example, as shown below, the motherboard manufacturer should be Dell and the device model should be Vostro 270.

3. Close the window when you finish noting down the information.

## How to download and install SATA Controller drivers

 After finding out your motherboard model, it’s time to download and install its corresponding driver.

There are two ways you can update your SATA Controller driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-download-sandisk-ssd-drivers-solved/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Motherboard manufacturers such as Intel keep updating their motherboard SSD Controller drivers. To get them, you need to go to their official websites, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.  
  
 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 If you have an AMD motherboard, you may refer to **[this post](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for further information about how to download the AMD SATA Controller drivers.
