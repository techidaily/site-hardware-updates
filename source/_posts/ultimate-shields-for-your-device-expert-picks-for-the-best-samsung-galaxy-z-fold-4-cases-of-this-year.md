##  What to Look For in a Galaxy Z Fold 4 Case

 The [Galaxy Z Fold 4](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-unlock-reddit-potentials-stepwise-procedures-for-sharing/) is not your typical phone. Its [foldable form factor](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/step-beyond-reality-reviewing-lgs-virtual-vision-for-2024/) makes picking a suitable case slightly tricky. It's important to keep a few things in mind before you go case shopping.

 Most importantly, many Galaxy Z Fold 4 cases don't cover the whole phone and leave the hinge unprotected. This is fine when you use the phone in its unfolded state and the hinge is hidden. But when carrying the phone around folded, the hinge is bare and at risk of damage if you accidentally drop it. So, if you fear you will end up dropping your phone often, it's a good idea to invest in a case that has a hinge cover.

 Another vital detail about Z Fold 4 cases is that many use adhesive to offer a secure fit. But every time you remove the case and put it back on, the adhesive loses some strength. Eventually, it stops holding the case in place.

 If you like to swap cases frequently to match your wardrobe or activity, look for cases with a single-piece design as they are less likely to rely on adhesives to hold the case in place compared to cases with a two-piece design.

 Besides this, you must decide which type of case you want. All the usual options like clear, rugged, leather, and slim cases are available for the Samsung foldable. Each has advantages and disadvantages, but these differences are down to preference, and these types are not any different than the average phone case.

 Lastly, if you want to use [S Pen](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Electronics-Pressure-Included-Compatible/dp/B098TTKX6J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204759&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F827621%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) with the phone, it's better to go for a case that can accommodate it. If your case doesn't work with the S Pen, it'll be frustrating remembering and carrying your stylus around.

 With the basics out of the way, let's dive into our recommendations.

| Pros                          | Cons                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Hinge protection            | ✗ No wireless charging support through case |
| ✓ Built-in magnetic kickstand |                                             |
| ✓ Multiple color options      |                                             |
| ✓ Built-in screen protector   |                                             |

 This [Galaxy Z Fold 4 case from Ruky](https://www.amazon.com/Ruky-Kickstand-Protection-Protector-Protective/dp/B0B7BGXFD9?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204759&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F827621%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) combines a unique aesthetic with a durable design that’ll stand up to plenty of accidental drops. It features complete hinge protection, magnetic closure, and a built-in touch-sensitive screen protector to prevent scratches and cracks.

 Ruky's case is made with a soft PU leather material, and it feels slim and comfortable in hand. There’s a built-in magnetic kickstand that’ll support your phone while you’re talking on a video call or watching a video. The hinge structure also allows you to easily manipulate the angle of your screen if you don’t want to prop up your entire device with the kickstand.

 The Ruky Z Fold 4 case comes in six different colors, so it’s easy to find something that’ll fit your style. The only downside to this case is that it doesn’t support wireless charging. If you want to wirelessly charge your phone, you’ll need to take this case off first.

[Ringke Slim](https://www.amazon.com/Ringke-Slim-Anti-Yellowing-Compatible-Transparent/dp/B0B6Y42G7B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204759&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F827621%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) will add decent protection to your brand-new foldable without being too pricy, a common problem with many Fold 4 cases. As the case's name suggests, it's also pretty slim at 1.2mm and adds only about 15 grams to the phone's weight.

 The company has used scratch-resistant polycarbonate material in its construction, so this case won't look beat up within days of using it. Also, depending on which variant you're buying, you'll get a different finish, mixing up how it looks and feels. The [Black version](https://www.amazon.com/Ringke-Slim-Anti-Yellowing-Compatible-Transparent/dp/B0B6Y42G7B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204759&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F827621%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) has a soft-touch finish, whereas the [Clear version](https://www.amazon.com/Ringke-Slim-Anti-Yellowing-Compatible-Transparent/dp/B0B6YCMQYQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204759&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F827621%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is glossy. The [Matte Clear](https://www.amazon.com/Ringke-Slim-Anti-Yellowing-Compatible-Transparent/dp/B0B6XW6YTQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204759&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F827621%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) case will give you a matte finish.

 Given it's a thin case, it has no problem supporting wireless charging or reverse wireless charging. There are also clear cutouts for ports and buttons.

 Sadly, there is no hinge cover, and if you frequently drop your phone, it's probably not the best option for you as there are no shock absorption enhancements. Our [best overall](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/top-5-ios-downloader-tools-seamless-access-to-fb-videos-and-events/) or [rugged](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-screen-snatching-made-easy-analyzing-no-cost-recording-apps/) recommendations will be better if you need top-notch protection.

[Speck's Presidio Perfect Clear](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fspeck-presidio-perfect-clear-case-for-samsung-galaxy-z-fold4-clear%2F6515613.p) is an excellent transparent case for the Galaxy Z Fold 4\. It allows you to show off your phone without worrying about dropping and damaging it. The case also includes anti-yellowing material, so you won't have to stress about it [turning yellow](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/conquering-instagrams-video-challenges-head-on/) after a few weeks.

 One of the major highlights of the Speck case is its one-piece design that ensures that it always has a secure fit with the phone. In addition, the case comes with anti-microbial treatment to stop the growth of stain and odor-causing bacteria. It also has a relatively slim form factor and supports wireless charging.

 In terms of protection, the Speck Presidio Perfect Clear can withstand drops up to 13 feet when the case is open. However, when the case is folded, it leaves the hinge unprotected, which is a problem with many other Z Fold 4 cases.

 If you don't want to add unnecessary bulk to an already hefty Z Fold 4, the [OtterBox Thin Flex](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fotterbox-thin-flex-series-carrying-case-for-samsung-galaxy-fold4-black%2F6514688.p) is the case to get. It offers the company's signature military-grade drop protection without being too thick or too heavy.

 The case's two-piece design is easy to install or remove and stays out of the way of the phone's features. The company also uses an anti-microbial coating on the case to protect its exterior from all sorts of bacteria. And if you care about sustainability, you'll be happy to know that more than 50% of the plastic used in the case is recycled.

 In terms of drawbacks, the case has no hinge protection, so you will have to be careful when you are carrying or holding the phone in its folded state.

 Lastly, the case supports wireless charging and is available in three colors---[Black](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fotterbox-thin-flex-series-carrying-case-for-samsung-galaxy-fold4-black%2F6514688.p), [Pacific Reef](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fotterbox-thin-flex-series-carrying-case-for-samsung-galaxy-fold4-pacific-reef%2F6514696.p%3FskuId%3D6514696), and [Sparkle Perplexing](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fotterbox-thin-flex-series-carrying-case-for-samsung-galaxy-fold4-sparkle-purplexing%2F6515366.p). Both Pacific Reef and Sparkle Perplexing have transparent elements to flaunt the phone's design.

 Spigen is a top-notch phone case brand, and its [Thin Fit P case for the Galaxy Z Fold 4](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZMGQK4C?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204759&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F827621%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers the best built-in S Pen solution. Some phone cases accommodate the S Pen on the back, but the side cutout for the S Pen slot on this Thin Fit P case is a more convenient location.

 The Thin Fit P case has a modern, slim design that’s easy to grip, hold, and store away in your pocket or your bag. It also folds smoothly, an essential feature for a unique phone like the Z Fold 4\. Raised edges around the screen and camera array prevent scratches and add extra protection in case you accidentally drop your phone.

 There’s unfortunately no hinge protection with this case, but if you’re not prone to dropping your phone constantly, this shouldn’t be an issue. Spigen’s Thin Fit P case does, however, support wireless charging, so you won’t need to take the case off your phone before charging wirelessly.

So you don't compromise in bulk but still get top-notch protection.

 The UAG Civilian case for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 is significantly improved over the Civilian case for the [Z Fold 3](https://www.amazon.com/URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR-Ultra-Thin-Shock-Absorbent/dp/B09B199HW5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204759&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F827621%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The two-piece design has become one piece, and there is now a hinge protector. Both are welcome changes and greatly enhance the case's overall performance.

 Additionally, UAG says the case meets military-grade drop test standards thanks to its impact-resistant bumpers and a soft core. The case's enhanced grip also makes it easy to hold the phone.

 The essentials, like wireless charging support, raised edges, and precise cutouts, are also present on the Civilian. However, the rough military look may not be for everyone. If you're not a fan, you might be more interested in the [best overall](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/top-5-ios-downloader-tools-seamless-access-to-fb-videos-and-events/) option.

On the outside, the case is decorated with a two-tone design using premium faux leather, and there are seven different color combinations to choose from. Inside, you’ll find spots for three cards and a small pocket for cash, and a small leather cloth fits over your cards to prevent scratches to your phone’s screen.

 Below the premium faux leather layer, there’s a layer of microfiber and a layer of RFID-blocking material to keep your personal information safe. The case features an easy magnetic closure, a strap to help you hold your phone securely, and a built-in adjustable kickstand to prop up your phone for video calls or streaming sessions.

 This is a thicker case than most, which might not be for everyone, but it’ll add some extra cushion and protection to your phone if you accidentally drop it. Because it’s a thicker case, it doesn’t support wireless charging. You’ll need to slip the case off your Z Fold 4 to wirelessly charge it.

| ✓ 24 exciting designs | ✗ Not a case replacement |
| ✓ Thin and grippy     | ✗ Can be expensive       |

[dbrand skins](https://dbrand.com/shop/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-skins) are a great way to customize the look of your phone to match your style. You get tons of designs to cover your Galaxy Z Fold 4, from simpler options like Seafoam Green to intricate ones like Swarm. Some dbrand skins even use special materials instead of the usual vinyl. For example, its leather skins use 100% genuine, full-grain, vegetable-tanned leather.

 The company has released 24 skins for the new Samsung foldable, covering the back and the rear camera module. The installation process is relatively easy, but some skins may require more effort than others. Still, you get plenty of help from the company's demo video. Plus, the skins are extremely precise and offer a perfect fit and finish.

 Another advantage of using dbrand skins is that they leave no residue behind. So if you want to remove a skin from your phone, you will get back the original design with no evidence to suggest that there was ever a skin gracing that phone.

 While these skins are not a replacement for a case, they do protect your phone from scratches and minor cosmetic damage.
