Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 I bought the original Logitech Keys-To-Go keyboard almost a decade ago, around 2015, because I wanted the absolute thinnest, most minimal keyboard to throw in my backpack and type on my iPad better than I could with the on-screen keyboard.

 That one worked okay with its fabric exterior and squishy membrane keys. It wasn't great though. (I still have it and it still works.) I mention this history because the second version of the product has a lot to live up to and will likely be on shelves for another 10 years.

 Instead of a flat, cardboard-like keyboard, the Keys-To-Go 2 resembles a more standard, modern keyboard, with scissor keys. The noticeable difference is that it’s squished down to 8.77mm at its tallest point. I was surprised at how small the box it came in was and then again at how minimal it felt in my hand. Its 222-gram weight is downright negligible in a backpack.

 If you’re keeping track, there are two versions of the new Keys-To-Go 2, one with a more universal layout and the other a more iPad-centric one. The most noticeable key is the universal one having an escape key where the iOS uses that space for a home button. Both should work with all Bluetooth devices though.

 Like the first version, Keys-To-Go 2 can handle multiple Bluetooth devices and quickly switch between them with dedicated keys. Unlike that one, however, the new version is not rechargeable. It uses coin cell batteries for power. That means never having to plug it into power, but it also means replacing those batteries somewhere around 36 months.

 Even if the keyboard were to only last 24 months on its built-in battery power in practice, two years feels like a fair trade-off to me. Another year is that much better.

 To round out the features, there are plenty of shortcut keys for media and other tasks. There’s also an attached cover. Right away, I wasn’t thrilled by the always-connected cover. It’s thoughtful for travel, but it can be pretty distracting while using the keyboard.

 I couldn’t lay the cover out flat behind the keyboard unless I had a ton of room on whatever surface it was on. In practice that didn’t work on the small tables at Starbucks. The other option is to fold the cover underneath, but, especially at first, that felt inelegant.

![Logitech Keys-To-Go 2 folded on top of its cover on a table](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/53784746960_6279912402_o.jpg)

 Ultimately, I did come to just accept the fact that the inside of the cover, the part that touches the keys, was also the part resting on dirty surfaces. The cover does prop up the keyboard ever-so-slightly, but not enough to make a difference. The design of the cover just doesn’t make much sense to me.

##  Figuring Out Which iPad Keyboard to Buy

 You can use the Keys-To-Go 2 with any Bluetooth device, especially with the universal layout, but I’m convinced it’s a product that was made for iPads.

 I used it with my [Vision Pro](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/how-to-correctly-address-msstdfmtdll-file-absence-on-windows-computers/). It worked great with Apple's headset for light productivity. I paired it to my Mac to test that. (If you use it with Windows or Mac, you can use Logitech's desktop software for advanced features.) But I primarily used it with my [iPad Pro (M4)](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-tutorial-to-bypass-your-oneplus-ace-2v-face-lock-by-drfone-android/).

 So it’s not whether this is a good keyboard for an iPad, but rather, deciding if this is the keyboard you should buy for your iPad use. Let’s break it down.

 You can go with an official Apple keyboard case. The company has one that fits each of the tablets it sells. The problem with that option is that it adds bulk (and cost). If you don’t type every day on your iPad or treat the device like a laptop, then that option is probably overkill.

 Having an iPad in a Smart Folio for general use and then connecting the Keys-To-Go 2 on a plane, train, or while out traveling keeps the tablet slimmer and doesn’t take up too much room in a bag while on the road.

 I loved typing on the keyboard. Even though the keys weren’t as springy as Apple’s desktop Magic Keyboard, I thought its scissor keys were bouncy enough. My fingers didn’t fatigue as easily as when using the original Keys-To-Go. That one was like trying to run through the mud. You needed fingers of steel to have prolonged productivity with the original one. This new one is much better in that regard.

 The one omission when giving up Apple’s option is forfeiting a trackpad. I had to keep reaching out and positioning my cursor within my text document. It’s less ideal for frequent, every single day, use. So again, if you use your iPad like a laptop, Apple’s Magic Keyboard for iPad is probably the way to go. But if you just need an infrequent Bluetooth keyboard, this is the solution.

##  Should You Buy the Logitech Keys-To-Go 2?

![Logitech Keys-To-Go 2 with its cover open](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/53784323756_0f5797ec81_o.jpg) 

Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 From the first moment I held the [Logitech Keys-To-Go 2](http://www.logitech.com/keys-to-go2-universal) keyboard I knew I would be buying one of my own. It’s an ideal size and its key action is springy enough to support prolonged typing—for as long as my brain can keep up. I love the Keys-To-Go 2 simple design and its basic features.

 I will maintain that the cover isn't great, it should be removable or not present. But I also found I could work around it. It’s a wonderful keyboard for temporary use, especially if you don’t need one enough to justify buying Apple’s Magic Keyboard for iPad case.

 The keyboard’s $80 price tag is steep. But if you do need something like this, then it’s probably worth its cost. It’s a great ultra-portable solution.
