### Method 1: Update Razer Blade 17 Drivers from Razer Support

 In this part, we will show you how to find the newest drivers via Razer Support for Razer Blade 17 and install them.

 You can visit the Razer Support site to check for the latest versions of drivers, or search for a particular kind of driver that you need. Most of the device manufacturers will update their drivers at regular intervals via this website.

 But before you start, you need to get information about your device model and the Windows operating system.

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

1. Open[Razer Support](https://support.razer.com/) page.
2. In the Search Support box, type the name of your device model and press**Enter** . For example, if you want to update drivers for Razer DeathAdder Essential, a kind of gaming mice, you can type and search the exact words**Razer DeathAdder Essential** .

### Method 2: Update Razer Blade 17 Drivers from Windows Update

 Another way to get updated drivers for Razer Blade 17 is utilizing Windows Update. It’s a Windows built-in tool used to download and install device drivers to Windows. Windows Update takes you less time to find and install the correct driver versions.

 However, you’re not guaranteed to get the latest driver updates you need for your Razer laptop through this method because it remains difficult for manufacturers to get a driver into Windows Update.

 If you don’t mind, you can still follow the steps below (taking Windows 10 as an example). But we recommend that you choose **[Method 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to prevent underlying problems.

1. On the left-end of your screen, click the**Search icon** and type**Windows Update** . Then click**Check for updates** as it pops up as a matching result.
