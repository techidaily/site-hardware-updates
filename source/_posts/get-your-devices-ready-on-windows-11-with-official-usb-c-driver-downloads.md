**Looking for drivers for the Epson DS-530 scanner** ? If yes, then you’re in the right place! Here’re 2 ways you can download and install the Epson DS-530 driver, with just a few clicks.

## Why do you need the Epson DS-530 driver

 A driver is basically a software component that connects a device to the computer. For example, a scanner needs a driver to work properly. So if your device isn’t working, you should check the driver first.

 Drivers are mostly written by the manufacturer. If Windows doesn’t provide the driver for your device, you’ll then have to install the driver yourself. Sometimes, your computer might run into problems if some drivers are missing or outdated.

 Here’re 2 ways you can download and install the driver for Epson DS-530:

1. **[Download and install the driver automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/epson-ds-530-driver-download-for-windows/#option1)**
2. **[Download and install the driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Option 1: Download and install the driver automatically (Recommended)

 You can do this manually, if you like, by visiting the manufacturer’s download page, finding the right drivers, etc. But that takes time and computer skills. If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
