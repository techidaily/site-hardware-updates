If you want to keep your PC at its tip-top performance, it is very important that you update your device drivers regularly, especially your display card driver.

[**Method Two: Reinstall graphics card driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[**Method Three: Update manually (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/radeon-hd-7850-graphics-driver-download-update-on-windows-10/#3)

 5) Then wait for Windows to get the latest version of the graphics driver it can find for you.  
  
 If you see the notification:  
  
 **Windows has determined the driver software for your device is up to date.**

 1) Go to **AMD support** website. Scroll down a little bit to locate**Radeon HD 7000 series** section. Then choose the operating system that you are with accordingly. We choose **Windows 10 (64-bit)** .
