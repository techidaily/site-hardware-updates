## Intel Decides Against Issuing Product Recalls for Faulty Processors

It's never fun to lose hardware over a manufacturer issue, but usually, when that's the case, the manufacturer will take care of it for free. Intel is dealing with failing processors right now, but at least for now, affected CPU owners shouldn't hold out hopes for a recall.

 Intel has confirmed that a patch is coming in mid-August to address the root cause of the [elevated voltage issue](https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/top-10-video-restoration-tools-compatible-with-windows-and-macos/), which is causing instability in 13th and 14th Gen Core processors. However, the patch won't be any good for already damaged chips, and your only option will be to replace it if it's permanently damaged. While the patch will prevent further damage, any damage that has already taken place is permanent.

 The company has stated that chips with 65W or higher base power could be affected, but not all of them. Intel is not issuing a recall and has not halted sales, but recommends customers experiencing instability contact customer support. The fact that it's not issuing a recall is a bit shocking, to say the least, since there are a lot of these chips out in the wild and they continue to be sold.

 The company is confident the patch will be effective for chips not yet experiencing symptoms and is investigating ways to easily identify affected processors. Customers with already damaged CPUs are advised to contact Intel for replacement. If you do have an affected chip, you might get lucky with your warranty. For those not yet experiencing issues, updating the BIOS and adhering to Intel Default Settings is recommended.

 Intel is working on remedies and promises more information soon, but this situation certainly raises a lot of concerns for any potential Intel users. Personally, I've been loyal to AMD for years, and it looks like I've made the right decision.
