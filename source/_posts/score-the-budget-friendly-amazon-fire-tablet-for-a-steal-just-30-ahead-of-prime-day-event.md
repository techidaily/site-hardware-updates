## Score the Budget-Friendly Amazon Fire ^Tablet for a Steal - Just $30 Ahead of Prime Day Event

Amazon Fire tablets are popular for streaming media and basic games, mostly because they're incredibly cheap. [Prime Day](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-top-7-costless-tools-enjoy-your-dvds-on-laptops/) is officially a week away, but the sale event is already live for some Amazon products.

 The Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10 aren't on sale yet, but the cheapest Fire 7 is now available at a discount. You can now get the cheapest model, with 16 GB of internal storage and advertisements on the lock screen, for $29.99\. That's a $20 discount (40%) from the usual price, though there have been a few "Lightning Deals" that brought the cost down.

[Buy at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FKR6KXF?tag=htg-v2-vhrv33t-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205354&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F816461%2Fget-the-amazon-fire-7-tablet-for-just-30-before-prime-day%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) 

 The [Fire 7](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FKR6KXF?tag=htg-v2-vhrv33t-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205354&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F816461%2Fget-the-amazon-fire-7-tablet-for-just-30-before-prime-day%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is the lowest-end device in Amazon's tablet product line, with a 7-inch screen, 2 GB of RAM, a MediaTek MT8168V/B chipset, and Fire OS 8 (based on Android 11). Even though it's not the most powerful tablet around, it does have a few features that aren't common on most tablets in this price range, like a USB Type-C connector and dual-band Wi-Fi.

 The current sale is limited to Amazon Prime subscribers, and even though it's supposed to last for the next four days, stock is already limited. The 16 GB Fire 7 with lockscreen advertisements is backordered (Amazon says it "usually ships within 2 to 3 weeks," while pricier the 32 GB model with ads is completely sold out. However, the 16 GB and 32 GB models without ads are still available with fast shipping.

 The Fire 7 isn't the best tablet around, especially since it lacks the Google services you would normally find on most Android devices, but you can't ask for a lot in a $30 tablet.
