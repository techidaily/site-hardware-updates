## Top Picks for Portable Laptop Screens - Your Ultimate Shopping List!

Arzopa is offering deep discounts on its portable monitors as an early Amazon Prime Day deal. So why wait and suffer with only one laptop monitor any longer?

 A portable monitor might sound like an unnecessary accessory for your laptop... until you try and get work done on one small screen when you're used to at least a bigger monitor on a desktop. Then, suddenly, your productivity tanks, and it's a nightmare trying to do anything or switch tasks. If you're a gamer on the go, you know how hard it can be to play a game and try and keep track of something like Discord with only one screen, as well.

 In short, single-monitor life is tough. So why suffer it when you're on a laptop? Pick up a [portable monitor](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/does-airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location-on-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) and have dual monitors wherever you go. Now is the perfect time to pick one up, as well—as part of early Amazon Prime Day sales, Arzopa is heavily discounting a variety of portable monitors!

 My top recommendation is the [A1 GAMUT Portable Monitor](https://amazon.com/dp/B091GFZNJ5?tag=htgprimedaysite-20). [Our review](https://windows11.techidaily.com/unlock-the-code-three-ways-to-access-game-folders/) explains why it's such a great choice!

 \[I\]t's a really useful piece of kit that looks good, is easy to transport, and works with just about everything. I've spent a couple of weeks with it, and I like it so much I'm thinking of buying one myself.

 For Prime Day, you can pick up the A1 GAMUT for $129.99—after the general price drop from $189.99 to $149.99 and the $20 discount, this is a fantastic deal for what this portable monitor offers.
