However, apps and games require precious storage space too. We’ll show you how to see which apps use the most.</p><p> It’s easy to see which of your apps are using the most storage space right from the Google Play Store. To get started, open the Play Store and tap your profile icon in the search bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-28_16-59-08.jpg"                      alt="Tap your profile icon."                > </p><p> Next, select “Manage Apps &amp; Device” from the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-28_16-59-45.jpg"                      alt="Select &quot;Manage Apps and Device.&quot;"                > </p><p> Switch over to the “Manage” tab and you’ll see all the installed apps and games on your Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-28_17-00-41.jpg"                      alt="Switch to the &quot;Manage&quot; tab."                > </p><p> By default, the apps will be ordered by recent updates. Tap “Recently Updated” and select “Size” instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-28_17-01-24.jpg"                      alt="Sort by &quot;Size.&quot;"                > </p><p> The app list will now be ordered with the largest apps at the top.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="My-Journey-Away-From-Mobile-Melodies-Why-I-Became-a-Less-Frequent-User-of-Phone-Tunes"><a href="#My-Journey-Away-From-Mobile-Melodies-Why-I-Became-a-Less-Frequent-User-of-Phone-Tunes" class="headerlink" title="My Journey Away From Mobile Melodies: Why I Became a Less Frequent User of Phone Tunes"></a>My Journey Away From Mobile Melodies: Why I Became a Less Frequent User of Phone Tunes</h2><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Due to battery and storage limitations, it only makes sense to stream lossy files on smartphones, but lossy files shed information to make files more manageable, which diminishes audio quality.</li><li>DAPs offer more high-resolution lossless audio support, extensive EQ settings, and longer battery life than smartphones.</li></ul><p> Did you know the standard music on your smartphone plays from low-quality audio files? Upon learning this, I jumped ship from smartphones to digital audio players (DAPs), especially after understanding the clear benefits concerning sound and functionality.</p><h2 id="The-Problem-With-Smartphone-Audio"><a href="#The-Problem-With-Smartphone-Audio" class="headerlink" title="The Problem With Smartphone Audio"></a>The Problem With Smartphone Audio</h2><p> The issue isn’t that smartphones don’t support <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/24-engineering-engaging-media-excerpts/" >high-resolution (hi-res) audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. At this point, Apple and Android allow users to download and stream hi-res content. The issue, however, is that smartphones aren’t designed to play hi-res <em>well.</em> </p><p> Most of the audio you listen to—whether through Spotify, Apple Music, or another streaming service—offers <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-turning-insta-vids-into-music-your-complete-guide/" >lossy audio files <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, like MP3 or Advanced Audio Coding (AAC).</p><p> The problem? Lossy files are compressed heavily, meaning they remove bits of information to reduce the file size because it makes them easier to transfer, stream, and download. However, the data removed from lossy files contains sound information. The more they’re compressed, the less they sound like the original recording.</p><p> It’s these lossy files that you listen to on the average music library or streaming platform. However, you can access hi-res audio, as most smartphones have functions to download and even stream <a class="link"   href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-missing-photos-files-from-nova-y91-by-fonelab-android-recover-photos/" >hi-res or lossless <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> files.</p><p> Lossless files also compress audio but do so in a way that doesn’t delete sound information. The result is a smaller file that keeps the original sound almost completely intact.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/46b4f41f.png"                      alt="Apple Earpods and iPhone with Spotify logo on the screen. Spotify - online streaming audio service."                > </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/apple-earpods-iphone-spotify-logo-on-1443489164" >Primakov&#x2F;Shutterstock.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><em>So why not just use a smartphone if it supports hi-res?</em> </p><p> When I was first looking into this, that was my first thought. However, once I started using my smartphone to stream&#x2F;download hi-res audio, I ran into three major problems:</p><ul><li>Extreme data usage</li><li>Larger file sizes took up too much phone storage</li><li>Fast battery drainage</li></ul><p> It all boils down to this: even top-tier smartphones aren’t built to handle hi-res audio alongside all the other phone functions. Hi-res files are too big and require too much data and battery. I even discovered that longer listening sessions caused my iPhone to overheat.</p><p> Through trial and error, I decided to try a DAP.</p><h2 id="Taking-the-Leap-to-Digital-Audio-Players-5-Benefits-of-DAPs"><a href="#Taking-the-Leap-to-Digital-Audio-Players-5-Benefits-of-DAPs" class="headerlink" title="Taking the Leap to Digital Audio Players: 5 Benefits of DAPs"></a>Taking the Leap to Digital Audio Players: 5 Benefits of DAPs</h2><p> Owning a DAP was a game-changer for someone like myself who sought the highest possible audio quality. It allowed me to download, manage, and listen to a wide range of hi-res formats on a dedicated device with many intuitive features designed to level up casual listening experiences.</p><p> I chose <a class="link"   href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/walkman-digital-recorders/walkman-mp3-players/p/nwa306-b" >Sony’s Walkman NW-A306 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which cost me about $350. It’s a compact, all-round hi-res audio player that supports over 10 different file types and offers many great features, a 10-band EQ, and a plethora of connectivity options. While the Walkman NW-A306 is a mid-tier model, price-wise, DAPs begin at around $50 and go as high as $5,000–$10,000. But even the most affordable DAPs beat smartphones for many reasons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sony-walkman-nw-a306.jpg"                      alt="Sony Walkman NW-A306"                > </p><p>Sony</p><p>Photo of the model DAP I bought, the Sony Walkman NW-A306</p><h3 id="Broad-Audio-Format-Support"><a href="#Broad-Audio-Format-Support" class="headerlink" title="Broad Audio Format Support"></a>Broad Audio Format Support</h3><p> While smartphones support certain hi-res audio files, like Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC), managing them is a major hassle. For example, Apple forces you to manage all FLAC files within the <a class="link"   href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/life360-circle-everything-you-need-to-know-on-nokia-105-classic-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >Apple Files app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or third-party service, meaning you can’t just stream them. Furthermore, you need an external <a class="link"   href="https://www.howtogeek.com/854336/how-to-listen-to-hi-res-audio-on-iphone-and-ipad/" >digital-to-analog converter (DAC) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to support true hi-res content.</p><p> Apple did introduce its own lossless audio file format, <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118295" >Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which works on Apple Music and doesn’t require an external DAC. However, it’s also not a true hi-res format, as it only supports up to 24-bit files. Also, it doesn’t address issues of battery drainage and storage.</p><p> DAPs are excellent because they come with larger digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) chipsets. These chipsets support many alternative hi-res audio types, including those that reach up to 32-bit sampling rates, which is the definition of true hi-res.</p><h3 id="Feature-Rich-EQ-Settings"><a href="#Feature-Rich-EQ-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Feature-Rich EQ Settings"></a>Feature-Rich EQ Settings</h3><p> Access to hi-res formats is merely the foundation for the ultimate listening experience. DAPs offer a wide range of amazing audio features that blow smartphones out of the water. For example, smartphones may have EQ settings and presets, but they’re usually limited.</p><p> A good DAP truly gives you the power to personalize your music-listening experience, meaning great filters for eliminating muddy bass, sharp highs, and a long list of genre-specific presets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eq-settings.JPG"                      alt="Basic EQ Settings"                > </p><p> Plenty of Storage Room DAPs offer great storage dedicated to music and music only. You also get the added benefit of additional phone storage for any non-music-related content.</p><p> Depending on the model, a DAP starts with 12–120GB of storage space. However, the amount of storage you need depends on the type of audio files you plan to support. For example, <a class="link"   href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-value-panoramic-recording-equipment-for-savvy-shoppers/" >an uncompressed WAV file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers the highest audio quality but uses about 10MB per minute, whereas a FLAC file takes up close to 3MB per minute.</p><p> If you’re worried about storage, many DAPs offer extensions to enlarge it by 1–2TB for an added cost.</p><h3 id="Great-Battery-Life"><a href="#Great-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="Great Battery Life"></a>Great Battery Life</h3><p> By eliminating the need to support a seemingly infinite number of tools and apps, DAPs support continuous playback that spans at least 12 hours. If you go for a higher-quality device, you can find options that last 72 hours—no problem.</p><h3 id="Zero-Distraction-Listening"><a href="#Zero-Distraction-Listening" class="headerlink" title="Zero Distraction Listening"></a>Zero Distraction Listening</h3><p> The four benefits listed above are why I decided to make the initial switch. However, the largest reason why I stuck with my DAP was for the distraction-free listening experience.</p><p> Smartphones are anything but calming, pushing a flurry of notifications which causes users a degraded listening experience. After switching to a DAP, I discovered an entirely different relationship with my music.</p><p> With DAPs, when you’re listening, you’re listening. You don’t have to worry about your smartphone pinging and buzzing, meaning you enjoy the high-quality experience to a greater degree.</p><h2 id="What-About-DAP-Streaming"><a href="#What-About-DAP-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="What About DAP Streaming?"></a>What About DAP Streaming?</h2><p> Many hear the term DAP and assume I’m referencing some old MP3 player or a clunky Walkman. Contrary to belief, DAPs have come a long way. Now, they offer listening experiences on par with any smartphone.</p><p> Most offer speedy Wi-Fi connections and extensive music-oriented app libraries, meaning users can download streaming services, like Spotify and SoundCloud. However, remember you’ll need to download a streaming service that allows you to stream with your desired audio format. Spotify, for example, doesn’t yet offer lossless audio.</p><h2 id="The-Future-of-Digital-Audio"><a href="#The-Future-of-Digital-Audio" class="headerlink" title="The Future of Digital Audio"></a>The Future of Digital Audio</h2><p> For the sake of transparency, when I’m on the go I still find myself listening to music on my iPhone. However, for serious listening sessions DAPs offer unbeatable quality, features, versatility, and storage.</p><p> Bottom line: Don’t forsake a one-trick pony, at least for now.</p><p> As smartphones evolve to obtain greater storage, battery life, and hi-res audio file support, one day there might be little reason to invest in a separate device. However, that time is a long way off, and smartphones simply aren’t advanced enough to power hi-res audio.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

An APK file is a specialized ZIP file containing all the necessary data for installing an app on an Android device, including its code, assets, and resources. Think of it like an EXE file on Windows.</p><p> Until August 2021, APK was the standard format for publishing and distributing Android apps on the Google Play Store. After that, Google introduced the <a class="link"   href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-the-artisans-guide-to-tiktok-captions-top-5-craftsmanship-strategies-for-2024/" >AAB (Android App Bundle) format <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which delegates the process of APK generation. AABs are now the required format for developers to upload their apps to the Play Store. Then, how are APKs still useful?</p><p> AABs didn’t replace APKs. In fact, the app bundle <em>creates</em> an APK specifically for your device. APKs also make it easy to install apps from sources other than the Play Store. They allow you to download updates that haven’t yet been released on the Play Store, install older versions of apps, and install delisted apps or apps that haven’t been approved for the Play Store.</p><h2 id="Are-APK-Files-Legal-and-Safe-to-Download"><a href="#Are-APK-Files-Legal-and-Safe-to-Download" class="headerlink" title="Are APK Files Legal and Safe to Download?"></a>Are APK Files Legal and Safe to Download?</h2><p> Developers must adhere to Google Play Developer Program Policies and Developer Distribution Agreements to publish their apps on the Google Play Store. Additionally, <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/king-video-dominance-hashtag-hacks-exposed-for-2024/" >Google uses Play Protect <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which conducts safety checks before downloading apps. So, apps installed from the Google Play Store are generally safe.</p><p> However, when you manually install an app using an APK file, you bypass safety protocols and may unknowingly install a malicious file. To prevent potential infection, always download APK files from the official developer’s website. If you opt for another source, ensure it is trustworthy. Also, you can <a class="link"   href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/pinnacle-tools-for-subs-to-srt-unveiling-the-top-8-win-and-mac-software-for-2024/" >use tools like VirusTotal to confirm the file is safe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before downloading it.</p><p> Downloading APKs is considered legal only when sourced from the official website. Using a third-party website, which may have altered the APK file to access premium features, violates copyright laws. Moreover, downloading pirated or cracked copies of apps without the developer’s consent is highly unethical.</p><h2 id="How-to-Install-an-APK-File-on-Android"><a href="#How-to-Install-an-APK-File-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="How to Install an APK File on Android"></a>How to Install an APK File on Android</h2><p> To <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-premium-quality-streaming-on-the-worlds-largest-network/" >install an APK file on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, first download it from a trusted source.

So, APK files are incompatible with iOS or iPadOS and cannot be opened on these platforms.

We’ll show you how it works.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-revealing-the-top-10-hidden-story-supporters/" >DNS stands for “Domain Name System,” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and it connects web servers to their respective domain names. Your internet provider provides its own DNS server, but you can change which one your devices use. There are <a class="link"   href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-oneplus-open-pattern-lock-screen-everything-you-need-to-know-by-drfone-android/" >plenty of advantages to using a custom DNS server <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-revealing-the-top-10-hidden-story-supporters/" >What Is DNS, and Should I Use Another DNS Server? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p> Changing the DNS server on your Android phone is slightly different than on other devices. You can’t just enter the string of numbers—Cloudflare is 1.1.1.1, for example. Instead, you’ll need the full TLS hostname. For Cloudflare, that’s 1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com. You can find this for whichever DNS server you’d like to use.</p><p> First, swipe down once or twice (depending on your phone) from the top of the screen and tap the gear icon to open the Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2021-06-10_16-45-27.png?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1"                      alt="Tap the gear icon."                > </p><p> Next, select “Network &amp; Internet” or “Connections.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screenshot_20220217-153053.png"                      alt="Select &quot;Network and Internet.&quot;"                > </p><p> Scroll down and select “Private DNS.” On Samsung phones, you will need to go to “More Connection Settings” before you can see Private DNS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screenshot_20220217-153058.png"                      alt="Select &quot;Private DNS.&quot;"                > </p><p> Switch to “Private DNS Provider Hostname” and enter the hostname.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Lenovo-ThinkBook-Plus-5-The-Ultimate-Dual-OS-Convertible-Laptop-Experience"><a href="#Lenovo-ThinkBook-Plus-5-The-Ultimate-Dual-OS-Convertible-Laptop-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Lenovo ThinkBook Plus 5: The Ultimate Dual-OS Convertible Laptop Experience"></a>Lenovo ThinkBook Plus 5: The Ultimate Dual-OS Convertible Laptop Experience</h2><p>We’re all familiar with 2-in-1 laptops and know what to expect from these convertible devices. At CES 2024, Lenovo delivered a wildly different hybrid you’ll want to see. Its new ThinkBook Plus 5 runs Windows 11 and Android, giving you the best of both worlds.</p><p> Most manufacturers think of Windows 2-in-1 as the ultimate productivity machine, but we all know that Windows 11 works best as a laptop, not a tablet. That’s why with Lenovo’s crazy new hybrid, the bottom packs everything you need for a capable Windows 11 computing experience, while in the top half (behind the stunning display), you’ll find all the Android bits.</p><p> In laptop mode, the experience is similar to any other clamshell. The Lenovo ThinkBook Plus 5 Hybrid packs a powerful Intel Core Ultra 7 and Intel Arc GPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, a 1TB SSD, all-day battery life, Harmon Kardon speakers, USB-C, a fingerprint reader, etc. Everything you want and need from a laptop.</p><p>Close </p><p> However, Android comes to life once you yank the impressive 14-inch 2.8K OLED display from the keyboard dock. Up top and inside the display is an Android-friendly Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 processor, 12GB of RAM, another 256GB of internal storage, and more. The tablet has another USB-C port, front and rear cameras, four little 1W speakers, and a 38 Whr battery.</p><p> Essentially, it’s a fully-featured standalone Android 13 tablet. However, when you want to build a presentation or be more productive, snap it into the keyboard that houses all the Windows 11 goods and get to work.</p><p> This might be one of the craziest devices we’ve seen at CES this year. It’s worth noting that, at least right now, the two operating systems don’t play nicely together. By that, I mean you can’t work on a project or program in Windows 11, then yank off the screen and continue working from Android while sitting on the patio or a plane. They are two entirely separate systems. However, there is a hybrid folder that will automatically sync files you need to both devices.</p><p> These days, there are plenty of <a class="link"   href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/solving-the-reset-failed-there-was-an-error-message-on-windows/" >great 2-in-1 laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to choose from. However, Lenovo says the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid should arrive in Q2 and run you about $2,000 if you want to try something unique and new.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/ai-powered-creativity-productivity-devices-solutions-ces-2024/" >Lenovo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

There are some great features you may not know about that you can start using right away to make your life easier. We’ll help you find them.</p><h2 id="Send-Messages-at-a-Scheduled-Time"><a href="#Send-Messages-at-a-Scheduled-Time" class="headerlink" title="Send Messages at a Scheduled Time"></a>Send Messages at a Scheduled Time</h2><p> You can schedule a message on Samsung Messages to send at a later date, similar to how you <a class="link"   href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/my-videos-arent-playing-on-honor-play-8t-what-can-i-do-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/" >schedule emails <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To do that, enter a conversation and type your message, then tap the arrow in the left corner. Next, tap the plus icon and select “Schedule Message” from the grid of options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/messaging-options-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Messaging options in Samsung Messages"                > </p><p> Set your desired schedule and press “Done.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/schedule-message-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Schedule message in Samsung Messages"                > </p><p> Now, just hit the send button, and your message will be sent at the appropriate time.</p><p> There’s a slightly faster way to schedule messages. Instead of going to the grid of options, you can simply long-press the send button after typing your message to reveal the scheduler. Set your desired date and time and hit “Done” to confirm.</p><h2 id="Customize-Your-Chat-Rooms"><a href="#Customize-Your-Chat-Rooms" class="headerlink" title="Customize Your Chat Rooms"></a>Customize Your Chat Rooms</h2><p> You can customize the chat rooms you share with your favorite contacts to give them a special look and feel. Open your desired conversation, tap the three-dots menu at the top, and select “Customize Chat Room” from the list of options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/conversation-settings-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Conversation settings in Samsung Messages"                > </p><p> Here, you will be able to change the background color, the opacity of the chat bubbles, and the text contrast. Use the slider to control the intensity of the effect as per your taste. You can even use an image from your gallery for the chat room background by tapping the gallery icon. If you want to start over or remove all the changes made, just hit “Reset” to revert to the default look.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/customize-chat-room-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Customize chat room in Samsung Messages"                > </p><h2 id="Categorize-Conversations-for-Easier-Organization"><a href="#Categorize-Conversations-for-Easier-Organization" class="headerlink" title="Categorize Conversations for Easier Organization"></a>Categorize Conversations for Easier Organization</h2><p> You can categorize conversations to make it easier to find messages from contacts that are important to you. To do this, go to the main screen, tap the three-dots menu at the top, and select “Edit Categories” from the drop-down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/edit-conversation-categories-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Edit conversation categories in Samsung Messages"                > </p><p> Here, tap “Add Category” and then give it a name. You may want to create separate categories for family members or coworkers, for example. Once done, tap “Add.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/annotely_image-3.jpeg"                      alt="Adding conversation category in Samsung Messages"                > </p><p> Next, select the conversations that you want to add to this category. Scroll down or use the search toolbar to find and select your desired contacts. Tap “Done” to confirm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/conversation-categories-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Conversation categories in Samsung Messages"                > </p><p> This category will now appear on the main page, so you can tap it and quickly jump to your favorite contacts.</p><h2 id="Glance-at-Important-Info-From-Automated-Messages"><a href="#Glance-at-Important-Info-From-Automated-Messages" class="headerlink" title="Glance at Important Info From Automated Messages"></a>Glance at Important Info From Automated Messages</h2><p> One of the best features of Samsung Messages is Useful Cards. With it, you can quickly glance at information from automated messages without having to read them all one by one. It organizes messages about upcoming events, ongoing sales and offers, and even confirmation messages about bank transactions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/useful-cards-tab-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Useful Cards tab in Samsung Messages"                > </p><p> You can find the Useful Cards tab on the main page itself since it comes turned on by default, but if it’s not so on your device, you can enable it from the settings. Tap the three-dots menu and select “Settings” from the drop-down and hit “More Settings.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/settings-menu-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Settings menu in Samsung Messages"                > </p><p> Here, toggle on “Useful Cards.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/useful-cards-toggle-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Useful Cards toggle in Samsung Messages"                > </p><h2 id="Auto-Delete-Old-Messages-to-Save-Space"><a href="#Auto-Delete-Old-Messages-to-Save-Space" class="headerlink" title="Auto-Delete Old Messages to Save Space"></a>Auto-Delete Old Messages to Save Space</h2><p> If you’re like most people, your inbox is probably flooded with thousands of old messages, most of which are irrelevant automated messages from companies. Samsung Messages can help you get rid of them to make room for new messages and images.</p><p> To use this feature, go to the “More Settings” menu and toggle on “Delete Old Messages.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/delete-old-messages-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Delete old messages in Samsung Messages"                > </p><p> Once you reach 1000 texts or 100 multimedia files, the app will auto-delete the oldest messages to free up storage space for new ones. This way, you never have to worry about deleting old messages manually.</p><h2 id="Retrieve-Deleted-Messages-From-the-Trash"><a href="#Retrieve-Deleted-Messages-From-the-Trash" class="headerlink" title="Retrieve Deleted Messages From the Trash"></a>Retrieve Deleted Messages From the Trash</h2><p> Deleted messages are usually irretrievable in messaging apps, which sucks in case you accidentally delete a message that you didn’t mean to. Luckily, Samsung Message accounts for moments like this. Messages that you delete manually aren’t immediately destroyed but instead stored in the trash for 30 days before permanently being deleted.</p><p> To retrieve an accidentally deleted message, tap the three-dots menu on the main page and select “Trash.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/trash-menu-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Trash menu in Samsung Messages"                > </p><p> Here, open your desired conversation, hit “Edit,” and select the message of your choice, then tap “Restore.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/restoring-a-deleted-message-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Restoring a deleted message in Samsung Messages"                > </p><p> The restored message will return to its original spot in the conversation.</p><h2 id="Create-Quick-Responses-for-Frequently-Sent-Messages"><a href="#Create-Quick-Responses-for-Frequently-Sent-Messages" class="headerlink" title="Create Quick Responses for Frequently Sent Messages"></a>Create Quick Responses for Frequently Sent Messages</h2><p> Samsung Messages comes with a couple of quick responses by default, such as “Sorry, I missed your call,” “I’m running late, but I’ll be there soon,” and “Please call me when you get this message.” These are useful, but you might have a particular response that you frequently send to multiple contacts.</p><p> So, to avoid the hassle of having to type your message again and again or copy and paste it repeatedly in the text bar of multiple conversations, you can create your own quick responses and add them to the list. To do this, go to the “More Settings” menu and tap “Quick Responses.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/quick-reponses-option-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Quick Responses option in Samsung Messages"                > </p><p> Here, tap the plus icon at the top, enter your message, and hit “Save” once you’re done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/adding-quick-response-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Adding quick response in Samsung Messages"                > </p><p> To delete a quick response, long-press it and hit “Delete.” You can adjust the position of your quick response using the slider to the side.</p><p> Although not necessary, I recommend toggling on “Show in Conversations.” Doing this shows you your saved quick responses in bubbles above the text entry field so that you can quickly tap your desired quick response and send it right away. This is much faster than having to first tap the plus icon, then select the “Quick Responses” option from the grid, and then select your desired response.</p><p> Here’s how it looks in action:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/quick-response-examples-in-conversations-in-samsung-messages.jpeg"                      alt="Quick Response examples in conversations in Samsung Messages"                > </p><hr><p> Samsung Messages is a really powerful messaging app, and you’re not using it to its full potential if you don’t dive into its settings and customize it to make it more suited to your needs. The features shown here are some of the most useful, but there are even more that offer different functionalities as well, so feel free to explore all of what the app has to offer!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

We all know it. They’re more unwieldy than they used to be, and yet we use them more than ever. You may have to live with a big phone, but thankfully, there are many ways to make your Android phone easier to use one-handed.</p><h2 id="Install-a-Different-Launcher"><a href="#Install-a-Different-Launcher" class="headerlink" title="Install a Different Launcher"></a>Install a Different Launcher</h2><p>Close </p><p> One of Android’s big advantages is you can swap out virtually the entire interface. The default home launcher is fine, but some alternatives may be much better suited for one-handed use.</p><p> My preference is <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003745/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher&hl=en_US" >Niagara Launcher <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Every aspect of the experience is meant to be easily navigated with a single thumb, <a class="link"   href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/fixing-the-unfixable-your-ultimate-compan-groach-on-keeping-state-of-decay-2-running-smoothly-tips-and-tricks/" >making Niagara Launcher ideal for big phones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Swiping along the side allows you to browse your app drawer, which is arranged in a list instead of a grid. It also doesn’t matter whether you’re right or left-handed since swiping either side of the screen is fine.</p><p> Other launchers give you the ability to customize every aspect of the interface yourself. <a class="link"   href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-vocal-ventures-merging-music-and-video-on-snapchat/" >Nova Launcher is worth checking out <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> largely because it’s one of the most customizable launchers, and you can configure things to make everything as accessible from the bottom of the screen as you want. But if you’re effectively going to build your own launcher, what kind of changes should you make?</p><h2 id="Move-the-Search-Bar-and-App-Icons-to-the-Bottom"><a href="#Move-the-Search-Bar-and-App-Icons-to-the-Bottom" class="headerlink" title="Move the Search Bar and App Icons to the Bottom"></a>Move the Search Bar and App Icons to the Bottom</h2><p>Close </p><p> Android phones stick the search bar at different parts of the screen. New Pixels put them at the bottom, as pictured above. As phones get taller, a search bar at the top is increasingly less accessible. If yours is still floating somewhere in the upper half of the screen, you can improve the situation by moving the bar to the bottom of the screen.</p><p> Some launchers have the search bar movable in the settings. In others, the search bar is a widget. You can place that widget wherever you want.</p><p> While you’re at it, place your most used icons at the bottom, too. Sure, your dock is already there, but you can create folders above that could potentially make every app you need easy to reach in the bottom right or left corner. You can even place a folder in the dock itself.</p><h2 id="​Move-Browser-Bars-to-the-Bottom-Too"><a href="#​Move-Browser-Bars-to-the-Bottom-Too" class="headerlink" title="​Move Browser Bars to the Bottom, Too"></a>​Move Browser Bars to the Bottom, Too</h2><p>Close </p><p> When you use a browser on a mobile phone, the address bar and tabs are generally also at the top. This mimics how browsers work on our desktops and laptops. But phones are not desktops, and the top is not the ideal place for these parts of the interface. Move them to the bottom instead.</p><p> Google Chrome does not give you this option, though you may have some luck searching through <strong>chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;flags</strong> or downloading an extension, depending on when you read this. Many other browsers require much less effort. The Samsung Internet browser is one of the most configurable, and moving the UI to the bottom is one of the available options. You can also move to tabs down if you’re using Vivaldi.</p><h2 id="Try-These-Samsung-Galaxy-Specific-Tweaks"><a href="#Try-These-Samsung-Galaxy-Specific-Tweaks" class="headerlink" title="Try These Samsung Galaxy-Specific Tweaks"></a>Try These Samsung Galaxy-Specific Tweaks</h2><p>Close </p><p> Samsung phones come with an abundance of customization options out of the box, but you can get even more by <a class="link"   href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-metaverse-mastery-rapidly-assemble-your-digital-self/" >installing Good Lock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This is an optional app from Samsung that lets you configure virtually every aspect of your phone.</p><p> Good Lock lets you change the way apps appear in the recent apps view. The default shows three apps at a time, which you swipe through horizontally. Good Lock offers a grid view that doubles the number of apps visible at once. You can then make all six of these apps easy to reach by enabling “Mini-Mode.” This shrinks the thumbnails down so that you can fit two rows in the bottom half of the screen.</p><p> There is even an entire module called One Hand Operation +. Here, you can shift most of your controls to the side of the screen. For example, in addition to swiping horizontally from the side to go back, you can swipe down at a diagonal to return home or swipe up at a diagonal to view recent apps. And that’s just scratching the surface.</p><p> Even without Good Lock, you can tweak the gestures used to navigate between apps. Samsung still ships phones with virtual buttons at the bottom of the screen, but you can replace this with gesture navigation like those on Pixels and iPhones. The thing is, there’s another gesture-based option called Swipe from Bottom. Swiping from the bottom right goes back. Swiping up from the bottom-left opens recent apps. Swiping from the middle goes home. I find these gestures faster than reaching up to the side of a screen to go back or dragging up and holding to switch apps.</p><p> You can find this option at Settings &gt; Display &gt; Navigation bar &gt; Swipe Gestures &gt; More Options &gt; Swipe from Bottom.</p><p> Samsung also offers edge panels, which function as docks that live at the side of the screen instead of the bottom. You can open an edge panel to manage apps, view contacts, access notes, see screenshots, and much more. You can configure these at Settings &gt; Display &gt; Edge panels.</p><h2 id="Check-Out-One-Handed-Mode"><a href="#Check-Out-One-Handed-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Check Out One-Handed Mode"></a>Check Out One-Handed Mode</h2><p>Close </p><p> Many phones come with a <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/24-unveiling-the-most-effective-honestly-approved-promotion-strategies/" >one-handed mode that shrinks your phone screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> down to a smaller version that tucks away into the bottom left or right corner. This way to reach the top of the screen, you don’t actually have to <em>reach</em> the top of the screen.</p><p> Personally, I don’t make much use of this mode. It makes it feel like most of my screen is going to waste and leaves me wondering why I have such a big phone in the first place. I prefer other tweaks that make the phone more usable in its regular state. Still, there are many people for whom one-handed mode might be the only tweak they need to make their phone usable enough.</p><h2 id="Talk-to-Your-Phone-More"><a href="#Talk-to-Your-Phone-More" class="headerlink" title="Talk to Your Phone More"></a>Talk to Your Phone More</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/voice-input-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Keyboard voice input icon on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5"                > </p><p>Bertel King &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Voice transcription is now remarkably good. No matter what phone you’re using, there’s a microphone button visible somewhere on the virtual keyboard. Give it a tap, and start talking whenever you need to type.</p><p> I now use this feature to write the first draft for many of my articles. I’m doing that right now while going for a walk in the woods. It doesn’t matter how big or small my screen is if I’m just talking to it.</p><p> You don’t have to turn to your voice only for writing. You can ask your phone questions using one of the various assistants, be that <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/24-unleash-creativity-without-breaking-the-bank-top-9-affordable-editors/" >Google Gemini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-get-hd-quality-quickly-enable-av1-in-youtube-settings/" >Microsoft Copilot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Voice commands are well-suited for web searches and in-car navigation.</p><p> In other words, don’t fuss with trying to tap every corner of your screen when you can just talk to it instead. Obviously, this is not always an option, but it may be an option more often than you think.</p><h2 id="Make-Your-Next-Phone-a-Foldable"><a href="#Make-Your-Next-Phone-a-Foldable" class="headerlink" title="Make Your Next Phone a Foldable"></a>Make Your Next Phone a Foldable</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-display-with-additional-apps-and-good-lock-widget.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 cover display with additional apps and Good Lock widget"                > </p><p>Dhruv Bhutani &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> This last tip isn’t of much help with using your current device, but keep it in mind when buying your next one. One of the things I love most about my <a class="link"   href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfecting-the-art-of-compelling-mosaic-imagery/" >Galaxy Z Fold 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is how it has a large inner screen for doing work, but, when folded, it’s actually smaller than most of my recent phones. It’s both shorter and less wide, despite its usually tall aspect ratio. Even with its added thickness, I find it more pocketable and easier to hold.</p><p> The smallest phones you can buy today are not so-called small smartphones like the base iPhone or Galaxy S. No, they’re flip foldables like the <a class="link"   href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-ideal-tools-to-capture-your-pcs-display-on-windows-10-for-2024/" >Galaxy Z Flip 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the Motorola Razr+. While folded, you can get a lot done on just the outer displays, particularly with the Razr+. The screen is so small that every corner is accessible, yet you have a larger screen when you need it. Foldables are able to offer the best of both worlds.</p><hr><p> My Android phone has replaced my PC. Sometimes <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/into-the-world-of-chroma-keying-youtubes-guide-to-green-screens-for-2024/" >I use Samsung DeX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but most of the time I just use the large inner display. Hey, I used to carry around a netbook, and a foldable is far more versatile!</p><p> Many of the above tips have made my phone so quick and easy to use that I prefer its mobility over sitting at a desk. When you spend this much time working from a phone with a large screen, every small quality of life improvement helps, and it’s all just as helpful for derping around on the phone as well.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

It’s called “Running Services,” and it shows every single app that’s currently running on your device. You can also see each app’s corresponding processes and services, how much RAM it’s using, and how long it’s been running. This is also where you can stop those individual processes and services within apps, though you really shouldn’t need to do that.</p><h2 id="Force-All-Apps-to-Use-Dark-Mode"><a href="#Force-All-Apps-to-Use-Dark-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Force All Apps to Use Dark Mode"></a>Force All Apps to Use Dark Mode</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2023-01-17_13-35-48.jpg"                      alt="Force dark mode for all apps."                > </p><p> Android 10 introduced a <a class="link"   href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-vivo-lock-screen-clock-in-seconds-by-drfone-android/" >system-wide dark mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and many apps now support it. However, there are a few holdouts that may be an unwelcome blast of bright light in your face. You can fix this with the “Override Force-Dark” toggle.</p><p> Keep in mind that this is forcing apps to be displayed in a mode that they don’t officially support. You may run into some issues with text being unreadable or other wonkiness. Still, it’s a pretty neat trick.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-vivo-lock-screen-clock-in-seconds-by-drfone-android/" >How to Turn on Dark Mode on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Disable-or-Speed-Up-Animations"><a href="#Disable-or-Speed-Up-Animations" class="headerlink" title="Disable or Speed Up Animations"></a>Disable or Speed Up Animations</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2023-01-17_11-10-21.jpg"                      alt="Android animation scales."                > </p><p> When you move between apps and screens in Android, you’re spending some of that time looking at animations and waiting for them to go away.

You can actually look behind the curtain a bit on how this works by visiting the “Standby Apps” section in the Developer Options.</p><p> Each app is given one of five values: “Active,” “Working Set,” “Frequent,” “Rare,” or “Restricted.” “Active” is the high-end of usage, while “Restricted” is the lowest.

Just go to the Developer Options screen and enable the “Force 4x MSAA” option.</p><p> This will force Android to use 4x multisample anti-aliasing in OpenGL ES 2.0 games and other apps. This requires more graphics power and will probably drain your battery a bit faster, but it will improve image quality in some games.

However, if you want to display any app while charging your phone overnight, you can simply enable the “Stay Awake” option here. Android will keep your device’s screen on while charging and won’t turn it off.</p><hr><p> If you want to undo any of these changes, you can quickly erase all your custom options by sliding the “Use Developer Options” switch at the top of the screen to “Off.” Most of the options here are only useful to developers debugging their Android apps.

However, to take it to the next level, you should take full advantage of the clipboard feature to find everything you’ve copied. Let’s get started.</p><h2 id="What-is-the-Clipboard"><a href="#What-is-the-Clipboard" class="headerlink" title="What is the Clipboard?"></a>What is the Clipboard?</h2><p> The clipboard is where you can find recently copied items, such as text, links, and even images. Rather than only being able to access the most recently copied item, the clipboard allows you to see previously copied items and paste them as well.</p><p> Like many things in Android, the clipboard feature works differently depending on your <a class="link"   href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-7-phone-number-locators-to-track-vivo-y200e-5g-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >device’s flavor of Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The most universal method for using the clipboard is through a keyboard app. That’s the method we’ll be focusing on in this guide.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-the-Clipboard-on-Android"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-Clipboard-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the Clipboard on Android"></a>How to Use the Clipboard on Android</h2><p> First, you’ll need a keyboard app that has a clipboard feature. Two popular choices are Google’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU211447/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin" >Gboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU211447/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey" >SwiftKey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The clipboards in these two apps work very similarly, but we’ll be using Gboard in the screenshots below.</p><p> Once you have your <a class="link"   href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-construct-humor-memes-via-adobe/" >keyboard installed and set up <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, we can try the clipboard. Simply <a class="link"   href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-full-page-captures-solutions-when-safari-screenshots-fail/" >copy some text <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a URL, or even an image. Now go to the app where you’d like to paste whatever it is you copied and tap the text box to bring up the keyboard. Look for a clipboard icon in the top toolbar and tap it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screenshot_20240507-153059.png"                      alt="Clipboard icon on Gboard."                > </p><p> This will open the clipboard, and you’ll see the recently copied item at the front of the list. Simply tap any of the options in the clipboard to paste it into the text field. You may be asked to enable the clipboard at this point, in which case you won’t see older copied items.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screenshot_20240507-153112.png"                      alt="Select an item from the Gboard clipboard."                > </p><p> Android does not save items to the clipboard forever. After a while, the oldest clipboard items will be deleted. Both Gboard and SwiftKey allow you to “pin” items to the clipboard to prevent them from being deleted after an hour. This can be done by long-pressing an item and choosing the “Pin” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screenshot_20240507-153128.png"                      alt="Pin an item to the Gboard clipboard."                > </p><p> If you find yourself copying and pasting a lot on Android, the clipboard is an invaluable tool. You can copy a bunch of things at once and then paste them independently without hopping back and forth. It’s a good trick to know.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

However, kids also like music and podcasts, and young kids don’t have smartphones. An old iPhone or Android phone is the perfect music player.</p><h2 id="A-Kid-Friendly-Interface"><a href="#A-Kid-Friendly-Interface" class="headerlink" title="A Kid-Friendly Interface"></a>A Kid-Friendly Interface</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/simple-home-screen-android.jpg"                      alt="Simple home screen for Android."                > </p><p>Joe Fedewa &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> First things first—kids are remarkably quick to learn how to use touchscreens. You can find <a class="link"   href="https://amazon.com/dp/B09QHQL6CH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004353&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/old-phones-make-great-music-and-podcast-players-for-kids/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >cheap MP3 players with physical controls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but in my experience, it’s more difficult for a child to learn how to navigate these interfaces. A phone is almost certainly easier to use.</p><p> The beauty of an old phone—especially an Android phone—is you can really control and customize the experience. For example, I added a kid’s profile to a Google Pixel phone and installed <a class="link"   href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-vocal-ventures-merging-music-and-video-on-snapchat/" >Nova Launcher <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This allowed me to limit the apps available on the device, crank up the icon and font size, and create a super streamlined home screen.</p><p> The same general idea can be applied to most devices, whether it’s an iPhone or another Android device. The key is to remove as many apps as possible, put the media apps at the forefront, and let them listen to their heart’s content. Speaking of apps…</p><h2 id="Podcasts-and-Audio-Apps-for-Kids"><a href="#Podcasts-and-Audio-Apps-for-Kids" class="headerlink" title="Podcasts and Audio Apps for Kids"></a>Podcasts and Audio Apps for Kids</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/music-player-android-phone.jpg"                      alt="Music player on Android phone."                > </p><p>Joe Fedewa &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> The next thing you’ll need is some apps. There is no shortage of music and podcast apps targeted at kids—it just depends on what you’re looking for. One important thing to keep an eye out for is offline support, as you’re probably not going to dedicate a data plan to a wannabe iPod.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-mirror-pc-screen-to-tecno-spark-10-5g-phones-drfone-by-drfone-android/" >Spotify Kids <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <em>would</em> be a great option for people with a Family Plan, but it doesn’t support offline playback. Instead, I decided to go with an open-source app called “<a class="link"   href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.zionhuang.music/" >InnerTune <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ for music. On the podcast front, I went with <a class="link"   href="https://kidspod.app/" >KidsPod <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a huge collection of kid-friendly podcasts. The KidsPod+ subscription includes downloads for offline listening.</p><p> Of course, you can go as deep down the rabbit hole as you want with this. I tried to keep things as simple as possible—one app for music, one app for podcasts. Don’t hesitate to explore all the great offerings in <a class="link"   href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/lists/podcasts-and-audio-apps-for-kids" >audio entertainment for kids <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find what works for you.</p><h2 id="A-Nice-Pair-of-Kids-Headphones"><a href="#A-Nice-Pair-of-Kids-Headphones" class="headerlink" title="A Nice Pair of Kids Headphones"></a>A Nice Pair of Kids Headphones</h2><p> The last thing to complete the puzzle is a pair of headphones. Now, smartphones haven’t included headphone jacks for a while, so Bluetooth may be required. However, if you don’t want to worry about charging yet another device—and keeping the phone and headphones tethered has its advantages—<a class="link"   href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-effective-ways-to-unlock-icloud-account-without-password-from-apple-iphone-xr-by-drfone-ios/" >a simple dongle will do the trick <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> I decided to go with the <a class="link"   href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0CB91GB99?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004353&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/old-phones-make-great-music-and-podcast-players-for-kids/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Altec Lansing Kid Safe Wireless Headphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Samsung confirmed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-owners-can-test-one-ui-6-features-early-090008495.html"><em>Engadget</em></a> that the launch of the beta program for the Galaxy S23 series is delayed until further notice. If you want to give Android 14 a shot on your Samsung phone, you might still be in for an indefinite wait — it could be a few more days or weeks. Our original coverage can still be read below.</p><p> We’re in the second half of the year already, which means the time is almost nearing for the launch of the next major version of Android. Android 14 was announced by Google earlier this year, and it has been polished over the course of the last few months. The launch of the stable version of <a class="link"   href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/beginners-pathway-to-russian-currency-terminology/" >Android 14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is now imminent, and it will be landing on Samsung phones as well. The company has just shown off its take on Android 14, One UI 6 — and you can try it out early.</p><p> Samsung has announced the beta program for One UI 6, the company’s take on Android 14, which is expected to roll out to everyone within a few months. The beta program is opening up for Samsung Galaxy S23 users, so if you have a Galaxy S23, a Galaxy S23+, or a <a class="link"   href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fake-gps-on-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-for-mobile-legends-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >Galaxy S23 Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and you live in Germany, South Korea, or the United States, you can try out the next version of Android on your phone starting today. It’s to be expected that the program will eventually roll out to other phones down the road, like the Galaxy Z Fold 5, the Z Flip 5, the S22 series, and the Galaxy A54, but it will probably happen sometime within the next few weeks or months. The current flagships are always first in line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/samsung-one-ui-6.png"                      alt="Samsung One UI 6"                > </p><p>Samsung</p><p> As for what’s new with this update, you’ll be getting all the changes that will land as part of Android 14. These include passkeys, better bloatware management, automatic dual SIM switching, and much more. As for what’s Samsung-specific, for now, the company is pointing at a number of changes. The most noticeable one is a complete revamp to the way notifications, and the quick settings panel, look. There’s also a new default font, new emoji, a new custom camera widget that lets you preselect a camera mode and a storage location, and the option to set different lock screens according to the current mode and routine.</p><p> This seems like a rather big update from Samsung, and clearly, we’ll be seeing a lot more stuff as the months go by and the beta program goes forward, until it ultimately culminates with a stable release in a few months.</p><p> Source: Samsung</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

This is important for the long-term usability of your phone. <a class="link"   href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/the-verdict-on-vllo-performance-for-2024/" >Unlike the iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Android devices don’t have a super-easy way to check this.</p><p> What is battery health, anyway? The term “battery life” typically refers to how long the battery will last on a charge. Battery <em>health</em> tells us how much the battery is deteriorating. Low battery health means the battery will perform worse—discharge faster, get warm, etc.</p><h2 id="Check-Battery-Health-With-the-Hidden-Diagnostic-Menu"><a href="#Check-Battery-Health-With-the-Hidden-Diagnostic-Menu" class="headerlink" title="Check Battery Health With the Hidden Diagnostic Menu"></a>Check Battery Health With the Hidden Diagnostic Menu</h2><p> Samsung Galaxy devices have a built-in method for checking battery health through the settings, but that’s not possible on most other Android devices. There’s one method you can try that doesn’t require third-party apps, but it might not work for your specific phone.</p><p> This method uses <a class="link"   href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-bypassing-google-account-with-vnrom-bypass-for-zte-nubia-z60-ultra-by-drfone-android/" >Android’s hidden diagnostic menu <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that can be accessed by entering codes in the phone dialer. However, these codes do not work on all devices and mobile networks.</p><p> Open the phone app and enter <strong>*#*#4636#*#*</strong>. This will open a “Testing” menu that may include a “Battery information” section. You’ll see the battery health listed here.</p><p> If that didn’t work—there’s a good chance it won’t—you’ll need to use a third-party app.</p><h2 id="Check-Battery-Health-With-a-Third-Party-App"><a href="#Check-Battery-Health-With-a-Third-Party-App" class="headerlink" title="Check Battery Health With a Third-Party App"></a>Check Battery Health With a Third-Party App</h2><p> If the diagnostic menu trick doesn’t work, there are plenty of third-party apps in the Play Store that you can use to check battery health. One that we like is called “<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU207573/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=flar2.devcheck" >DevCheck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230922-111149.png"                      alt="DevCheck from the Play Store."                > </p><p> After installing the app, open it and navigate to the “Battery” tab at the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230922-140402.png"                      alt="Check &quot;Health&quot; on the Battery tab."                > </p><p> That’s all there is to it.</p><h2 id="How-to-Preserve-Battery-Health-on-Android"><a href="#How-to-Preserve-Battery-Health-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="How to Preserve Battery Health on Android"></a>How to Preserve Battery Health on Android</h2><p> Battery health is almost entirely tied to the number of charging cycles the battery has gone through. Simply put, charging your phone a lot is actually not good for the battery. Heat is also a bad thing for batteries, which can happen from overcharging—<a class="link"   href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/navigating-through-the-effects-of-quick-access-memory-and-delay-time-on-your-computers-operation/" >or just being left out in the sun <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> This may sound counterintuitive to the “don’t charge your phone a lot” advice, but one of the best things you can do for battery health is not to let it get down to 0% often. The battery in your smartphone is best kept between 20-80%. <a class="link"   href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-streamlining-your-workflow-with-mac-preview-complete-guide/" >iPhones can do this while charging overnight <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and some Android phones have the same thing.</p><p> Resisting the urge to overcharge your phone will go a long way, but we’ve got a <a class="link"   href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-infinix-gt-10-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >full guide with more tips for preserving battery health as well. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><hr><p> Battery health is generally not something you need to check frequently, but it can play a role in the longevity of your device if you <a class="link"   href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-perfecting-sound-with-advanced-audacity-methods/" >plan on using it for several years <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (which is a good thing to do).</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

So let’s make the right choice.</p><p> Unsurprisingly, this really comes down to how you personally use your Android phone. Everyone has different usage habits. For some, 128GB is enough.

Again, this will depend on how you use your phone, but we can make some general observations.</p><p> The two biggest users of storage for almost everyone will be system files and apps&#x2F;games. System files include the operating system and everything that goes along with making your phone actually usable. Apps can build up files after you download them and games sometimes require a lot of extra files too.</p><p> The next big storage eaters are most likely photos and videos. High-resolution photos and videos from modern Android phones can take up a lot of space. If you’re one of those people that never deletes anything, this is probably the area where you need more storage.</p><p> Beyond that, the next things are music, documents, and downloads. These things are really dependent on the person. If you use streaming music services, you probably don’t have any music files on your phone. Someone that works a lot with PDFs might have tons of those files.</p><p> In general, these are the things taking up space on your Android phone that you can control. Apps, games, photos, videos, music, documents, and downloads.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-recorded-reality-facebook-live-2023/" >How to Free Up Storage Space on Your Android Phone with Files by Google <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="How-to-Check-How-Much-Storage-Space-You-Use"><a href="#How-to-Check-How-Much-Storage-Space-You-Use" class="headerlink" title="How to Check How Much Storage Space You Use"></a>How to Check How Much Storage Space You Use</h2><p> There’s a good chance you already have an Android phone, which means we can look at how you’ve been using your storage already. It’s easy to check how much storage you’re using and which things are using the most.</p><p> First, swipe down once to twice from the top of the screen and tap the gear icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-03-28_17-00-03.jpg"                      alt="Tap the gear icon."                > </p><p> Then go to “Storage.” If you have a Samsung phone, you’ll go to “Battery and Device Care” first.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-03-28_17-03-18.jpg"                      alt="Select &quot;Storage.&quot;"                > </p><p> Here we can see how much storage you’re using, how much is left, and which things are using the most. There are a few things to take note of here.</p><p> The most obvious is how much of your allotted storage you’re using. In this case, I have a 128GB phone and I’m using 89GB of it. Let’s scroll down and see what’s using it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-03-28_17-04-27.jpg"                      alt="Storage usage."                > </p><p> Videos and images are responsible for about 17GB of that. I back up my photos to the cloud and occasionally clear out the old stuff. I have very few documents and games, plus all my music listening is done over streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-03-28_17-06-10.jpg"                      alt="Storage usage categories."                > </p><p> I’ve used this phone for over a year, which tells me 128GB is a good amount for my usage habits. I am basically just using the storage for photos and videos. For my next phone, I know 128GB is probably going to be fine.</p><h2 id="How-Much-Storage-Do-I-Need"><a href="#How-Much-Storage-Do-I-Need" class="headerlink" title="How Much Storage Do I Need?"></a>How Much Storage Do I Need?</h2><p> Now you can use this information to decide how much storage you need. If you are only keeping photos and videos and you’re not taking a crazy amount of them, 128GB with <a class="link"   href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/two-ways-to-track-my-boyfriends-nokia-g42-5g-without-him-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >some cloud storage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is most likely going to be enough.</p><p> Alternatively, if you don’t take a lot of photos, but you do like to keep your music library locally, you will also probably be fine with 128GB. That’s a much easier thing to figure out, though, as you can see the size of your music library.</p><p> It’s when you start bundling these things together that you should look to the bigger storage options. Taking a lot of photos and storing all your music on the device is going to eat up storage quickly. Playing a lot of big, intensive games and downloading large files every day is going to add up.</p><p> As a general rule, if all of your storage is being used in just one of these areas, you’ll probably be fine with 128GB. Otherwise, it’s time to spend a little more on some extra storage or <a class="link"   href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-mirror-your-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-screen-to-pc-with-chromecast-drfone-by-drfone-android/" >clear out some space. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-mirror-your-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-screen-to-pc-with-chromecast-drfone-by-drfone-android/" >How to Free Up Storage Space on Your Android Phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Thankfully, <a class="link"   href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/comprehensive-breakdown-of-theta-s-specifications/" >WhatsApp now offers this feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. We’ll show you how to transfer your chat history.</p><p> Unlike many messaging services, WhatsApp doesn’t keep your chat history in the cloud. When you sign in on a new device, your old <a class="link"   href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-instant-success-with-pc-and-mac-videos-on-tiktok/" >conversations won’t be there <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. That’s why the ability to transfer chats between devices is so important. Let’s do it.</p><p> There are a couple of things you will need. First, the Android device must run Android 12 and, most importantly, it can’t be set up yet. The transfer process must be performed during the initial phone setup process.</p><p> You will need one piece of hardware for this to work—a USB-C to Lightning cable.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Ditch-the-Bulky-Wallet-My-Magnetic-Phone-Case-Revolution"><a href="#Ditch-the-Bulky-Wallet-My-Magnetic-Phone-Case-Revolution" class="headerlink" title="Ditch the Bulky Wallet: My Magnetic Phone Case Revolution!"></a>Ditch the Bulky Wallet: My Magnetic Phone Case Revolution!</h2><p>For a long time, I carried a minimalist wallet with four card slots and a cash sleeve. But even the thinnest wallet is yet another thing to carry along with your phone and keys. So, I bought a MagSafe phone wallet to slim down my EDC for certain occasions, and something unexpected happened: it became my primary wallet.</p><h2 id="All-My-Essentials-in-One-Pocket"><a href="#All-My-Essentials-in-One-Pocket" class="headerlink" title="All My Essentials in One Pocket"></a>All My Essentials in One Pocket</h2><p> My “real” wallet is a far cry from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Colis6cwPQ" >George Constanza’s situation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>—a <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Herschel-Supply-Co-Charlie-Wallet/dp/B01M0P5J67?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003235&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/i-switched-to-a-magnetic-phone-wallet-and-im-never-going-back-heres-why/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Herschel Charlie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with just four cards and some cash. However, I didn’t like having an extra thing to carry when I was doing active things like running, biking, or kayaking. I couldn’t ditch the wallet completely because I sometimes needed it, but I figured I could slim down my carry.</p><p> The idea was to use the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JNPNGGD/ref=ppx%5Fyo%5Fdt%5Fb%5Fsearch%5Fasin%5Ftitle?ie=UTF8&psc=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003235&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/i-switched-to-a-magnetic-phone-wallet-and-im-never-going-back-heres-why/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >MagSafe wallet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> only for those times when I needed the essentials: phone, keys, credit card, ID. For a while, that’s exactly what I did. I’d grab my credit card and ID out of my real wallet, slap on the magnetic wallet, and be on my way. Afterward, I’d put the cards back into my real wallet and use that the rest of the time.</p><p> It’s very freeing to have all of your essentials in one pocket (well, <em>two</em> if you count my keys, I guess). The magnetic wallet makes my phone a nice compact carry-all. I never lose sight of my phone, so having my wallet attached to it gives me one less thing to worry about when I’m traveling light.</p><h2 id="You-Don’t-Need-to-Carry-as-Much-as-You-Think"><a href="#You-Don’t-Need-to-Carry-as-Much-as-You-Think" class="headerlink" title="You Don’t Need to Carry as Much as You Think"></a>You Don’t Need to Carry as Much as You Think</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2495ebb0.jpg"                      alt="Apple MagSafe leather wallet on iPhone 12 Pro"                > </p><p>Justin Duino &#x2F; Review Geek</p><p> I soon realized that my essentials are “essential” for a reason. I didn’t actually need half of the things in my wallet most of the time. I hardly ever use cash to buy things, and I can just <a class="link"   href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-essential-techniques-for-soundless-video/" >add my less-frequently used cards and loyalty cards to Google Wallet on my phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> That’s the reality we live in nowadays. <a class="link"   href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/mastering-digital-layer-combinations-at-home-for-2024/" >The U.S. was behind on mobile payments for a while <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but things are changing. I’m using my phone and smartwatch for tap-to-pay more and more. It’s still not quite at the point where I feel safe leaving my physical cards at home, but we’re getting close. Plus, I’m not interested in putting my ID on my phone.</p><p> That’s the big revelation I had from my magnetic wallet. I wasn’t carrying a lot to begin with, but even that was more than I needed. The same could be true for you, too.</p><h2 id="MagSafe-Works-With-Android-Phones-Too"><a href="#MagSafe-Works-With-Android-Phones-Too" class="headerlink" title="MagSafe Works With Android Phones, Too"></a>MagSafe Works With Android Phones, Too</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MagSafe-Ring-on-Pixel-5.jpg"                      alt="MagSafe Ring on Pixel 5"                > </p><p>Joe Fedewa &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> One last thing to note if you’re reading this from an Android phone—<a class="link"   href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/accelerate-audio-playback-on-spotify-safely-and-effectively/" >you can do this! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> One of the best purchases for my Pixel 7 was <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JNPNGGD/ref=ppx%5Fyo%5Fdt%5Fb%5Fsearch%5Fasin%5Ftitle?ie=UTF8&psc=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003235&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/i-switched-to-a-magnetic-phone-wallet-and-im-never-going-back-heres-why/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >this cheap MagSafe-compatible case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.
